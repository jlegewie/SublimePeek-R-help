 <h2>
 Obtain a Description of one or more Native (C/Fortran) Symbols
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>This finds and returns as comprehensive a description of one or more
 dynamically loaded or &lsquo;exported&rsquo; built-in native symbols.  For
 each name, it returns information about the name of the symbol, the
 library in which it is located and, if available, the number of
 arguments it expects and by which interface it should be called (i.e
 <code>.Call</code>, <code>.C</code>, <code>.Fortran</code>, or
 <code>.External</code>). Additionally, it returns the address of the
 symbol and this can be passed to other C routines which can
 invoke.  Specifically, this provides a way to explicitly share symbols
 between different dynamically loaded package libraries.  Also, it
 provides a way to query where symbols were resolved, and aids
 diagnosing strange behavior associated with dynamic resolution.
 </p>
 <p>This is vectorized in the <code>name</code> argument so can process
 multiple symbols in a single call.  The result is a list that can be
 indexed by the given symbol names.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 getNativeSymbolInfo(name, PACKAGE, unlist = TRUE,
                     withRegistrationInfo = FALSE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>name</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the name(s) of the native symbol(s) as used in a call
 to <code>is.loaded</code>, etc.  Note that Fortran symbols should be
 supplied as-is, not wrapped in <code>symbol.For</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>PACKAGE</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>an optional argument that specifies to which
 DLL we restrict the search for this symbol.  If this is
 <code>"base"</code>, we search in the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> executable itself.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>unlist</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical value which controls how the result is
 returned if the function is called with the name of a single symbol.
 If <code>unlist</code> is <code>TRUE</code> and the number of symbol names in
 <code>name</code> is one, then the <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> object
 is returned.  If it is <code>FALSE</code>, then a list
 of <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> objects is returned.
 This is ignored if the number of symbols passed in <code>name</code> is
 more than one. 
 To be compatible with earlier versions of this function, this
 defaults to <code>TRUE</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>withRegistrationInfo</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical value indicating whether, if
 <code>TRUE</code>, to return information that was registered with <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> about
 the symbol and its parameter types if such information is available,
 or if <code>FALSE</code> to return the address of the symbol.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>This uses the same mechanism for resolving symbols as is used
 in all the native interfaces (<code>.Call</code>, etc.).
 If the symbol has been explicitly registered by the DLL
 in which it is contained, information about the number of arguments
 and the interface by which it should be called will be returned.
 Otherwise, a generic native symbol object is returned.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>Generally, a list of <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> elements whose elements
 can be indexed by the elements of <code>name</code>  in the call.  Each
 <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> object is a list containing the following
 elements:
 </p>
 <table summary="R valueblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>name</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the name of the symbol, as given by the
 <code>name</code> argument.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>address</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>if <code>withRegistrationInfo</code> is <code>FALSE</code>,
 this is the native memory address of the symbol which can
 be used to invoke the routine, and also to
 compare with other symbol addresses.  This is an external pointer
 object and of class <code>NativeSymbol</code>.
 If <code>withRegistrationInfo</code> is <code>TRUE</code> and registration
 information is available for the symbol, then this is
 an object of class <code>RegisteredNativeSymbol</code> and is a reference
 to an internal data type that has access to the routine pointer and
 registration information.  This too can be used in calls to
 <code>.Call</code>, <code>.C</code>, <code>.Fortran</code> and
 <code>.External</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>package</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a list containing 3 elements:
 </p>
 
 <dl>
 <dt>name</dt><dd><p>the short form of the library name which can be used
 as the value of the <code>PACKAGE</code> argument in
 the different native interface functions.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>path</dt><dd><p>the fully qualified name of the DLL.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt>dynamicLookup</dt><dd><p>a logical value indicating whether dynamic
 resolution is used when looking for symbols in this library,
 or only registered routines can be located.</p>
 </dd>
 </dl>
     
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 <p>If the routine was explicitly registered by the dynamically loaded
 library, the list contains a fourth field
 </p>
 <table summary="R valueblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>numParameters</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the number of arguments that should be passed in
 a call to this routine.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 <p>Additionally, the list will have an additional class,
 being <code>CRoutine</code>, <code>CallRoutine</code>, <code>FortranRoutine</code> or
 <code>ExternalRoutine</code> corresponding to the R interface by which it
 should be invoked.
 </p>
 <p>If any of the symbols is not found, an error is immediately raised.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>name</code> contains only one symbol name and <code>unlist</code> is
 <code>TRUE</code>, then the single <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> is returned
 rather than the list containing that one element.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p>One motivation for accessing this reflectance information is to be
 able to pass native routines to C routines as function pointers in C.
 This allows us to treat native routines and <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> functions in a similar
 manner, such as when passing an <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> function to C code that makes
 callbacks to that function at different points in its computation
 (e.g., <code>nls</code>).  Additionally, we can resolve the symbol
 just once and avoid resolving it repeatedly or using the internal
 cache.  In the future, one may be able to treat <code>NativeSymbol</code>
 objects directly as callback objects.
