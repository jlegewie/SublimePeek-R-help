 <h2>Loading and Listing of Packages</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>library</code> and <code>require</code> load add-on packages.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 library(package, help, pos = 2, lib.loc = NULL,
         character.only = FALSE, logical.return = FALSE,
         warn.conflicts = TRUE, quietly = FALSE,
         keep.source = getOption("keep.source.pkgs"),
         verbose = getOption("verbose"))
 
 require(package, lib.loc = NULL, quietly = FALSE,
         warn.conflicts = TRUE,
         keep.source = getOption("keep.source.pkgs"),
         character.only = FALSE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>package, help</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the name of a package, given as a name or
 literal character string, or a character string, depending on
 whether <code>character.only</code> is <code>FALSE</code> (default) or
 <code>TRUE</code>).</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>pos</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the position on the search list at which to attach the
 loaded package.  Can also be the name of a position on the current
 search list as given by <code>search()</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>lib.loc</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a character vector describing the location of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 library trees to search through, or <code>NULL</code>.  The default value
 of <code>NULL</code> corresponds to all libraries currently known to
 <code>.libPaths()</code>.
 Non-existent library trees are silently ignored.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>character.only</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical indicating whether <code>package</code> or
 <code>help</code> can be assumed to be character strings.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>logical.return</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical.  If it is <code>TRUE</code>,  <code>FALSE</code> or
 <code>TRUE</code> is returned to indicate success.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>warn.conflicts</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, warnings are
 printed about <code>conflicts</code> from attaching the new
 package.  A conflict is a function masking a function,
 or a non-function masking a non-function.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>keep.source</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical. Now ignored.
 This argument does not apply to packages using lazy-loading:
 whether they have kept source is determined when they are installed.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, additional diagnostics are
 printed.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>quietly</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, no message confirming
 package loading is printed, and most often, no errors/warnings are
 printed if package loading fails.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>library(package)</code> and <code>require(package)</code> both load the
 package with name <code>package</code>.  <code>require</code> is designed for use
 inside other functions; it returns <code>FALSE</code> and gives a warning
 (rather than an error as <code>library()</code> does by default) if the
 package does not exist.  Both functions check and update the list of
 currently loaded packages and do not reload a package which is already
 loaded.  (Furthermore, if the package has a namespace and a name
 space of that name is already loaded, they work from the existing
 namespace rather than reloading from the file system.  If you want to
 reload such a package, call <code>detach(unload = TRUE)</code> or
 <code>unloadNamespace</code> first.)
 </p>
 <p>To suppress messages during the loading of packages use
 <code>suppressPackageStartupMessages</code>: this will suppress all
 messages from <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> itself but not necessarily all those from package
 authors.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>library</code> is called with no <code>package</code> or <code>help</code>
 argument, it lists all available packages in the libraries specified
 by <code>lib.loc</code>, and returns the corresponding information in an
 object of class <code>"libraryIQR"</code>.  The structure of this class may
 change in future versions.  In earlier versions of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>, only the names
 of all available packages were returned; use <code>.packages(all =
     TRUE)</code> for obtaining these.  Note that
 <code>installed.packages()</code>
 returns even more information.
 </p>
 <p><code>library(help = somename)</code> computes basic information about the
 package <code>somename</code>, and returns this in an object of class
 <code>"packageInfo"</code>.  The structure of this class may change in
 future versions.  When used with the default value (<code>NULL</code>) for
 <code>lib.loc</code>, the attached packages are searched before the libraries.
 </p>
 <p>In versions of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> prior to 2.14.0, a <code>.First.lib</code> function 
 would be called when a package without a namespace was attached.
 As of 2.14.0, all functions have namespaces; see 
 <code>.onLoad</code> for current behaviour, and &lsquo;Writing R Extensions&rsquo;
 for a description of the older mechanism.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>Normally <code>library</code> returns (invisibly) the list of attached
 packages, but <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> if <code>logical.return</code> is
 <code>TRUE</code>.  When called as <code>library()</code> it returns an object of
 class <code>"libraryIQR"</code>, and for <code>library(help=)</code>, one of
 class <code>"packageInfo"</code>.
 </p>
 <p><code>require</code> returns (invisibly) a logical indicating whether the required
 package is available.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Licenses</h3>
 
 
 <p>Some packages have restrictive licenses, and there is a mechanism to
 allow users to be aware of such licenses.  If
 <code>getOption("checkPackageLicense") == TRUE</code>, then at first
 use of a package with a not-known-to-be-FOSS (see below) license the
 user is asked to view and accept the license: a list of accepted
 licenses is stored in file &lsquo;<span class="file">~/.R/licensed</span>&rsquo;.  In a non-interactive
 session it is an error to use such a package whose license has not
 already been accepted.
 </p>
 <p>Free or Open Source Software (FOSS, e.g.,
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS</a>) packages are determined by
 the same filters used by <code>available.packages</code> but applied
 to just the current package, not its dependencies.
 </p>
 <p>There can also be a site-wide file &lsquo;<span class="file">R_HOME/etc/licensed.site</span>&rsquo; of
 packages (one per line).
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Formal methods</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>library</code> takes some further actions when package <span class="pkg">methods</span>
 is attached (as it is by default).  Packages may define formal generic
 functions as well as re-defining functions in other packages (notably
 <span class="pkg">base</span>) to be generic, and this information is cached whenever
 such a package is loaded after <span class="pkg">methods</span> and re-defined functions
 (implicit generics) are excluded from the list of conflicts.
 The caching  and check for conflicts require looking for a pattern of
 objects; the search may be avoided by defining an object
 <code>.noGenerics</code> (with any value) in the package.  Naturally, if the
 package <EM>does</EM> have any such methods, this will prevent them from
 being used.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>library</code> and <code>require</code> can only load an <EM>installed</EM>
 package, and this is detected by having a &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file
 containing a <span class="samp">Built:</span> field.
 </p>
 <p>Under Unix-alikes, the code checks that the package was installed
 under a similar operating system as given by <code>R.version$platform</code>
 (the canonical name of the platform under which R was compiled),
 provided it contains compiled code.  Packages which do not contain
 compiled code can be shared between Unix-alikes, but not to other OSes
 because of potential problems with line endings and OS-specific help
 files.  If sub-architectures are used, the OS similarity is not
 checked since the OS used to build may differ (e.g.
 <code>i386-pc-linux-gnu</code> code can be built on an
 <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> OS).
 </p>
 <p>The package name given to <code>library</code> and <code>require</code> must match
 the name given in the package's &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file exactly, even
 on case-insensitive file systems such as are common on MS Windows and
 Mac OS X.

 pkg &lt;- "splines"
 library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
 detach(pos = match(paste("package", pkg, sep=":"), search()))
 
 require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
 detach(pos = match(paste("package", pkg, sep=":"), search()))
 
 require(nonexistent)        # FALSE
 ## Not run: 
 ## if you want to mask as little as possible, use
 library(mypkg, pos = "package:base")
 
 ## End(Not run)</pre>
