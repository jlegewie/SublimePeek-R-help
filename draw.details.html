 <h2> Customising grid Drawing </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>These generic hook functions are called whenever a grid grob is drawn.
 They provide an opportunity for customising the drawing of a
 new class derived from grob (or gTree).
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 drawDetails(x, recording)
 draw.details(x, recording)
 preDrawDetails(x)
 postDrawDetails(x)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> A grid grob. </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>recording</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> A logical value indicating whether a grob
 is being added to the display list or redrawn from the display list. </p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>These functions are called by the <code>grid.draw</code> methods for grobs
 and gTrees.
 </p>
 <p><code>preDrawDetails</code> is called first during the drawing of a grob.
 This is where any additional viewports should be pushed (see,
 for example, <code>grid:::preDrawDetails.frame</code>).  Note that
 the default behaviour for grobs is to push any viewports in the
 <code>vp</code> slot, and for gTrees is to also push and up any viewports in the
 <code>childrenvp</code> slot so there is typically nothing to do here.
 </p>
 <p><code>drawDetails</code> is called next and is where any additional
 calculations and graphical output should occur (see, for example,
 <code>grid:::drawDetails.xaxis</code>.  Note that the default behaviour
 for gTrees is to draw all grobs in the <code>children</code> slot
 so there is typically nothing to do here.
 </p>
 <p><code>postDrawDetails</code> is called last and should reverse anything
 done in <code>preDrawDetails</code> (i.e., pop or up any viewports that were
 pushed;  again, see,
 for example, <code>grid:::postDrawDetails.frame</code>).  Note that the
 default behaviour for grobs is to pop any viewports that were pushed
 so there is typically nothing to do here.
 </p>
 <p>Note that <code>preDrawDetails</code> and <code>postDrawDetails</code> are
 also called in the calculation of <code>"grobwidth"</code> and
 <code>"grobheight"</code> units.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>None of these functions are expected to return a value.
