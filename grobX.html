 <h2>Create a Unit Describing a Grob Boundary Location</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>These functions create a unit object describing a location somewhere
 on the boundary of
 a grob.  They are generic.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 grobX(x, theta)
 grobY(x, theta)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A grob, or gList, or gTree, or gPath.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>theta</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>An angle indicating where the location is
 on the grob boundary.  Can be one of <code>"east"</code>,
 <code>"north"</code>, <code>"west"</code>, or <code>"south"</code>,
 which correspond to angles 0, 90, 180, and 270,
 respectively.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The angle is anti-clockwise with zero corresponding to a line
 with an origin centred between the extreme
 points of the shape, and pointing at 3 o'clock.
 </p>
 <p>If the grob describes a single shape, the boundary value should
 correspond to the exact edge of the shape.
 </p>
 <p>If the grob describes multiple shapes, the boundary
 value will either correspond to the edge of a bounding box around all of
 the shapes described by the grob (for multiple rectangles, circles,
 xsplines, or text), or to a 
 convex hull around all vertices of all shapes described by the grob
 (for multiple polygons, points, lines, polylines, 
 and segments).
 </p>
 <p>Points grobs are currently a special case because the convex hull
 is based on the data symbol <EM>locations</EM> and does not take
 into account the extent of the data symbols themselves.
 </p>
 <p>The extents of any arrow heads are currently <EM>not</EM> taken into account.
