 <h2>Running Time of R</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>proc.time</code> determines how much real and CPU time (in seconds)
 the currently running <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> process has already taken.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 proc.time()
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>proc.time</code> returns five elements for backwards compatibility,
 but its <code>print</code> method prints a named vector of
 length 3.  The first two entries are the total user and system CPU
 times of the current <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> process and any child processes on which it
 has waited, and the third entry is the &lsquo;real&rsquo; elapsed time
 since the process was started.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>An object of class <code>"proc_time"</code> which is a numeric vector of
 length 5, containing the user, system, and total elapsed times for the
 currently running <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> process, and the cumulative sum of user and
 system times of any child processes spawned by it on which it has
 waited.  (The <code>print</code> method combines the child times with those
 of the main process.)
 </p>
 <p>The definition of &lsquo;user&rsquo; and &lsquo;system&rsquo; times is from your
 OS.  Typically it is something like
 </p>
 <p><EM>The &lsquo;user time&rsquo; is the CPU time charged for the execution
 of user instructions of the calling process.  The &lsquo;system time&rsquo;
 is the CPU time charged for execution by the system on behalf of the
 calling process.</EM>
 </p>
 <p>Times of child processes are not available on Windows and will always
 be given as <code>NA</code>.
 </p>
 <p>The resolution of the times will be system-specific and on Unix-alikes
 times are rounded down to milliseconds.  On modern systems they will
 be that accurate, but on older systems they might be accurate to 1/100
 or 1/60 sec.  They are typically available to 10ms on Windows.
 </p>
 <p>This is a primitive function.
