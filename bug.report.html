 <h2>Send a Bug Report</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Invokes an editor or email program to write a bug report or opens a
 web page for bug submission.  Some standard information on the current
 version and configuration of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> are included automatically.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 bug.report(subject = "",  address,
            file = "R.bug.report", package = NULL, lib.loc = NULL,
            ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>subject</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Subject of the email.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>address</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Recipient's email address, where applicable: for
 package bug reports sent by email this defaults to the address of
 the package maintainer (the first if more than one is listed).</p>
 </td></tr> 
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>filename to use (if needed) for setting up the email.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>package</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Optional character vector naming a single package which is 
 the subject of the bug report.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>lib.loc</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A character vector describing the location of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 library trees in which to search for the package, or <code>NULL</code>.
 The default value of <code>NULL</code> corresponds to all libraries
 currently known.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>additional named arguments such as <code>method</code> and
 <code>ccaddress</code> to pass to <code>create.post</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>If <code>package</code> is <code>NULL</code> or a base package, this opens the R
 bugs tracker at <a href="http://bugs.r-project.org/">http://bugs.r-project.org/</a>.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>package</code> is specified, it is assumed that the bug report is
 about that package, and parts of its &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file are
 added to the standard information.  If the package has a
 <code>BugReports</code> field in the &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file, that URL
 will be opened using <code>browseURL</code>, otherwise an email
 directed to the package maintainer will be generated using
 <code>create.post</code>.  
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 <p>Nothing useful.</p>
 
 
 <h3>When is there a bug?</h3>
 
 
 <p>If <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> executes an illegal instruction, or dies with an operating
 system error message that indicates a problem in the program (as
 opposed to something like &ldquo;disk full&rdquo;), then it is certainly a
 bug.
 </p>
 <p>Taking forever to complete a command can be a bug, but you must make
 certain that it was really <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>'s fault.  Some commands simply take a
 long time.  If the input was such that you KNOW it should have been
 processed quickly, report a bug.  If you don't know whether the
 command should take a long time, find out by looking in the manual or
 by asking for assistance.
 </p>
 <p>If a command you are familiar with causes an <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> error message in a
 case where its usual definition ought to be reasonable, it is probably
 a bug.  If a command does the wrong thing, that is a bug.  But be sure
 you know for certain what it ought to have done.  If you aren't
 familiar with the command, or don't know for certain how the command
 is supposed to work, then it might actually be working right.  Rather
 than jumping to conclusions, show the problem to someone who knows for
 certain.
 </p>
 <p>Finally, a command's intended definition may not be best for
 statistical analysis.  This is a very important sort of problem, but
 it is also a matter of judgement.  Also, it is easy to come to such a
 conclusion out of ignorance of some of the existing features.  It is
 probably best not to complain about such a problem until you have
 checked the documentation in the usual ways, feel confident that you
 understand it, and know for certain that what you want is not
 available. The mailing list <code>r-devel@r-project.org</code> is a better
 place for discussions of this sort than the bug list.
 </p>
 <p>If you are not sure what the command is supposed to do
 after a careful reading of the manual this indicates a bug in the
 manual.  The manual's job is to make everything clear.  It is just as
 important to report documentation bugs as program bugs.
 </p>
 <p>If the online argument list of a function disagrees with the manual,
 one of them must be wrong, so report the bug.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>How to report a bug</h3>
 
 
 <p>When you decide that there is a bug, it is important to report it and
 to report it in a way which is useful.  What is most useful is an
 exact description of what commands you type, from when you start <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 until the problem happens.  Always include the version of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>, machine,
 and operating system that you are using; type <KBD>version</KBD> in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> to
 print this.  To help us keep track of which bugs have been fixed and
 which are still open please send a separate report for each bug.
 </p>
 <p>The most important principle in reporting a bug is to report FACTS,
 not hypotheses or categorizations.  It is always easier to report the
 facts, but people seem to prefer to strain to posit explanations and
 report them instead.  If the explanations are based on guesses about
 how <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> is implemented, they will be useless; we will have to try to
 figure out what the facts must have been to lead to such
 speculations.  Sometimes this is impossible.  But in any case, it is
 unnecessary work for us.
 </p>
 <p>For example, suppose that on a data set which you know to be quite
 large the command <code>data.frame(x, y, z, monday, tuesday)</code> never
 returns.  Do not report that <code>data.frame()</code> fails for large data
 sets.  Perhaps it fails when a variable name is a day of the week.  If
 this is so then when we got your report we would try out the
 <code>data.frame()</code> command on a large data set, probably with no day
 of the week variable name, and not see any problem. There is no way in
 the world that we could guess that we should try a day of the week
 variable name.
 </p>
 <p>Or perhaps the command fails because the last command you used was a
 <code>[</code> method that had a bug causing <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>'s internal data structures
 to be corrupted and making the <code>data.frame()</code> command fail from
 then on.  This is why we need to know what other commands you have
 typed (or read from your startup file).
 </p>
 <p>It is very useful to try and find simple examples that produce
 apparently the same bug, and somewhat useful to find simple examples
 that might be expected to produce the bug but actually do not.  If you
 want to debug the problem and find exactly what caused it, that is
 wonderful.  You should still report the facts as well as any
 explanations or solutions.
 </p>
 <p>Invoking <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> with the <span class="option">--vanilla</span> option may help in isolating a
 bug.  This ensures that the site profile and saved data files are not
 read.
 </p>
 <p>A bug report can be generated using the function <code>bug.report()</code>.
 For reports on <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> this will open the Web page at
 <a href="http://bugs.R-project.org/">http://bugs.R-project.org/</a>: for a contributed package it will
 open the package's bug tracker Web page or help you compose an email
 to the maintainer.
 </p>
 <p>Bug reports on <STRONG>contributed packages</STRONG> should not be sent to the
 R bug tracker: rather make use of the <code>package</code> argument.
