 <h2>
 Return the points that would be used to draw an Xspline
 (or a Bezier curve).
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Rather than drawing an Xspline (or Bezier curve), this function returns
 the points that would be used to draw the series of line
 segments for the Xspline.  This may be useful to post-process
 the Xspline curve, for example, to clip the curve.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 xsplinePoints(x)
 bezierPoints(x)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>An Xspline grob, as produced by the <code>xsplineGrob()</code> function
 (or a beziergrob, as produced by the <code>bezierGrob()</code> function).
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The points returned by this function will only be relevant
 for the drawing context in force when this function was called.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>Depends on how many Xsplines would be drawn.  If only one, then
 a list with two components, named x and y, both of which are
 unit objects (in inches).  If several Xsplines would be drawn
 then the result of this function is a list of lists.
