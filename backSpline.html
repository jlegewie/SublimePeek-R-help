 <h2>Monotone Inverse Spline</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Create a monotone inverse of a monotone natural spline.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 backSpline(object)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>an object that inherits from class <code>nbSpline</code> or
 <code>npolySpline</code>.  That is, the object must represent a natural
 interpolation spline but it can be either in the B-spline
 representation or the piecewise polynomial one.  The spline is
 checked to see if it represents a monotone function.
 </p>

 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>An object of class <code>polySpline</code> that contains the piecewise
 polynomial representation of a function that has the appropriate
 values and derivatives at the knot positions to be an inverse of the
 spline represented by <code>object</code>.  Technically this object is not a
 spline because the second derivative is not constrained to be
 continuous at the knot positions.  However, it is often a much better
 approximation to the inverse than fitting an interpolation spline to
 the y/x pairs.
