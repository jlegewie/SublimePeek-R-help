 <h2>Approximate String Distances</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Compute the approximate string distance between character vectors.
 The distance is a generalized Levenshtein (edit) distance, giving the
 minimal possibly weighted number of insertions, deletions and
 substitutions needed to transform one string into another.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 adist(x, y = NULL, costs = NULL, counts = FALSE, fixed = TRUE,
       partial = !fixed, ignore.case = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a character vector.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>y</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a character vector, or <code>NULL</code> (default) indicating
 taking <code>x</code> as <code>y</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>costs</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a numeric vector or list with names partially matching
 <span class="samp">insertions</span>, <span class="samp">deletions</span> and <span class="samp">substitutions</span> giving
 the respective costs for computing the Levenshtein distance, or
 <code>NULL</code> (default) indicating using unit cost for all three
 possible transformations.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>counts</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical indicating whether to optionally return the
 transformation counts (numbers of insertions, deletions and
 substitutions) as the <code>"counts"</code> attribute of the return
 value.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>fixed</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> (default), the <code>x</code>
 elements are used as string literals.  Otherwise, they are taken as
 regular expressions and <code>partial = TRUE</code> is implied
 (corresponding to the approximate string distance used by
 <code>agrep</code> with <code>fixed = FALSE</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>partial</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical indicating whether the transformed <code>x</code>
 elements must exactly match the complete <code>y</code> elements, or only
 substrings of these.  The latter corresponds to the approximate
 string distance used by <code>agrep</code> (by default).</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>ignore.case</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, case is ignored for
 computing the distances.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>useBytes</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> distance computations are
 done byte-by-byte rather than character-by-character.</p>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The (generalized) Levenshtein (or edit) distance between two strings
 <VAR>s</VAR> and <VAR>t</VAR> is the minimal possibly weighted number of
 insertions, deletions and substitutions needed to transform <VAR>s</VAR>
 into <VAR>t</VAR> (so that the transformation exactly matches <VAR>t</VAR>).
 This distance is computed for <code>partial = FALSE</code>, currently using
 a dynamic programming algorithm (see, e.g.,
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance</a>) with space
 and time complexity <i>O(mn)</i>, where <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are the
 lengths of <VAR>s</VAR> and <VAR>t</VAR>, respectively.  Additionally computing
 the transformation sequence and counts is <i>O(\max(m, n))</i>.
 </p>
 <p>The generalized Levenshtein distance can also be used for approximate
 (fuzzy) string matching, in which case one finds the substring of
 <VAR>t</VAR> with minimal distance to the pattern <VAR>s</VAR> (which could be
 taken as a regular expression, in which case the principle of using
 the leftmost and longest match applies), see, e.g.,
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching</a>.  This
 distance is computed for <code>partial = TRUE</code> using <span class="samp">tre</span> by
 Ville Laurikari (<a href="http://http://laurikari.net/tre/">http://http://laurikari.net/tre/</a>) and
 corresponds to the distance used by <code>agrep</code>.  In this
 case, the given cost values are coerced to integer.
 </p>
 <p>Note that the costs for insertions and deletions can be different, in
 which case the distance between <VAR>s</VAR> and <VAR>t</VAR> can be different
 from the distance between <VAR>t</VAR> and <VAR>s</VAR>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A matrix with the approximate string distances of the elements of
 <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, with rows and columns corresponding to <code>x</code>
 and <code>y</code>, respectively.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>counts</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, the transformation counts are
 returned as the <code>"counts"</code> attribute of this matrix, as a
 3-dimensional array with dimensions corresponding to the elements of
 <code>x</code>, the elements of <code>y</code>, and the type of transformation
 (insertions, deletions and substitutions), respectively.
 Additionally, if <code>partial = FALSE</code>, the transformation sequences
 are returned as the <code>"trafos"</code> attribute of the return value, as
 character strings with elements <span class="samp">M</span>, <span class="samp">I</span>, <span class="samp">D</span> and
 <span class="samp">S</span> indicating a match, insertion, deletion and substitution,
 respectively.  If <code>partial = FALSE</code>, the offsets (positions of
 the first and last element) of the matched substrings are returned as
 the <code>"offsets"</code> attribute of the return value (with both offsets
 <i>-1</i> in case of no match).

 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>
 ## Cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
 adist("kitten", "sitting")
 ## To see the transformation counts for the Levenshtein distance:
 drop(attr(adist("kitten", "sitting", counts = TRUE), "counts"))
 ## To see the transformation sequences:
 attr(adist(c("kitten", "sitting"), counts = TRUE), "trafos")
 
 ## Cf. the examples for agrep:
 adist("lasy", "1 lazy 2")
 ## For a "partial approximate match" (as used for agrep):
 adist("lasy", "1 lazy 2", partial = TRUE)
