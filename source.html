 <h2>Read R Code from a File or a Connection</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>source</code> causes <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> to accept its input from the named file or URL
 or connection.  Input is read and <code>parse</code>d from that file
 until the end of the file is reached, then the parsed expressions are
 evaluated sequentially in the chosen environment.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 source(file, local = FALSE, echo = verbose, print.eval = echo,
        verbose = getOption("verbose"),
        prompt.echo = getOption("prompt"),
        max.deparse.length = 150, chdir = FALSE,
        encoding = getOption("encoding"),
        continue.echo = getOption("continue"),
        skip.echo = 0, keep.source = getOption("keep.source"))
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a connection or a character string giving the pathname
 of the file or URL to read from.  <code>""</code> indicates the connection
 <code>stdin()</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>local</code></td>
 <td>
 <p><code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code> or an environment, determining
 where the parsed expressions are evaluated.  <code>TRUE</code> corresponds
 to the user's workspace (the global environment) and <code>FALSE</code> to
 the environment from <code>source</code> is called.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>echo</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical; if <code>TRUE</code>, each expression is printed
 after parsing, before evaluation.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>print.eval</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical; if <code>TRUE</code>, the result of
 <code>eval(i)</code> is printed for each expression <code>i</code>; defaults
 to the value of <code>echo</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>if <code>TRUE</code>, more diagnostics (than just
 <code>echo = TRUE</code>) are printed during parsing and evaluation of
 input, including extra info for <B>each</B> expression.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>prompt.echo</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character; gives the prompt to be used if
 <code>echo = TRUE</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>max.deparse.length</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>integer; is used only if <code>echo</code> is
 <code>TRUE</code> and gives the maximal number of characters output for
 the deparse of a single expression.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>chdir</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical; if <code>TRUE</code> and <code>file</code> is a pathname,
 the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> working directory is temporarily changed to the directory
 containing <code>file</code> for evaluating.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>encoding</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character vector.  The encoding(s) to be assumed when
 <code>file</code> is a character string: see <code>file</code>.  A
 possible value is <code>"unknown"</code> when the encoding is guessed: see
 the &lsquo;Encodings&rsquo; section.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>continue.echo</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character; gives the prompt to use on
 continuation lines if <code>echo = TRUE</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>skip.echo</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>integer; how many comment lines at the start of the
 file to skip if <code>echo = TRUE</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>keep.source</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical: should the source formatting be retained
 when echoing expressions, if possible?</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>Note that running code via <code>source</code> differs in a few respects
 from entering it at the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> command line.  Since expressions are not
 executed at the top level, auto-printing is not done.  So you will
 need to include explicit <code>print</code> calls for things you want to be
 printed (and remember that this includes plotting by <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lattice"><span class="pkg">lattice</span></a>,
 FAQ Q7.22).  Since the complete file is parsed before any of it is
 run, syntax errors result in none of the code being run.  If an error
 occurs in running a syntactically correct script, anything assigned
 into the workspace by code that has been run will be kept (just as
 from the command line), but diagnostic information such as
 <code>traceback()</code> will contain additional calls to
 <code>eval.with.vis</code>, an undocumented internal function.
 </p>
 <p>All versions of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> accept input from a connection with end of line
 marked by LF (as used on Unix), CRLF (as used on DOS/Windows) or CR
 (as used on classic Mac OS) and map this to newline.  The final line
 can be incomplete, that is missing the final end-of-line marker.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>keep.source</code> is true (the default in interactive use), the
 source of functions is kept so they can be listed exactly as input.
 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 <p>Unlike input from a console, lines in the file or on a connection can
 contain an unlimited number of characters.
 </p>
 <p>When <code>skip.echo &gt; 0</code>, that many comment lines at the start of
 the file will not be echoed.  This does not affect the execution of
 the code at all.  If there are executable lines within the first
 <code>skip.echo</code> lines, echoing will start with the first of them.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>echo</code> is true and a deparsed expression exceeds
 <code>max.deparse.length</code>, that many characters are output followed by
 <code> .... [TRUNCATED] </code>.  
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Encodings</h3>
 
 
 <p>By default the input is read and parsed in  the current encoding of
 the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> session.  This is usually what it required, but occasionally
 re-encoding is needed, e.g. if a file from a UTF-8-using system is to
 be read on Windows (or <EM>vice versa</EM>).
 </p>
 <p>The rest of this paragraph applies if <code>file</code> is an actual
 filename or URL (and not <code>""</code> nor a connection).  If
 <code>encoding = "unknown"</code>, an attempt is made to guess the encoding:
 the result of <code>localeToCharset()</code> is used as a guide.  If
 <code>encoding</code> has two or more elements, they are tried in turn until
 the file/URL can be read without error in the trial encoding.  If an
 actual <code>encoding</code> is specified (rather than the default or
 <code>"unknown"</code>) in a Latin-1 or UTF-8 locale then character strings
 in the result will be translated to the current encoding and marked as
 such (see <code>Encoding</code>).
 </p>
 <p>If <code>file</code> is a connection (including one specified by <code>""</code>,
 it is not possible to re-encode the input inside <code>source</code>, and so
 the <code>encoding</code> argument is just used to mark character strings in the
 parsed input in Latin-1 and UTF-8 locales: see <code>parse</code>.

 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>
 ## If you want to source() a bunch of files, something like
 ## the following may be useful:
  sourceDir &lt;- function(path, trace = TRUE, ...) {
     for (nm in list.files(path, pattern = "\\.[RrSsQq]$")) {
        if(trace) cat(nm,":")           
        source(file.path(path, nm), ...)
        if(trace) cat("\n")
     }
  }
