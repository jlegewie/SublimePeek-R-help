 <h2>Trace Copying of Objects</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>This function marks an object so that a message is printed whenever the
 internal function <code>duplicate</code> is called.   This happens when two
 objects share the same memory  and one of them is modified.  It is a
 major cause of hard-to-predict memory use in R.  
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 tracemem(x)
 untracemem(x)
 retracemem(x, previous = NULL)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>An R object, not a function or environment or <code>NULL</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>previous</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A value as returned by <code>tracemem</code> or <code>retracemem</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>This functionality is optional, determined at compilation, because it
 makes R run a little more slowly even when no objects are being
 traced.  <code>tracemem</code> and <code>untracemem</code> give errors when R is not
 compiled with memory profiling; <code>retracemem</code> does not (so it can be
 left in code during development).
 </p>
 <p>When an object is traced any copying of the object by the C function
 <code>duplicate</code> or by arithmetic or mathematical operations produces a
 message to standard output.  The message consists of the string
 <code>tracemem</code>, the identifying strings for the object being copied and
 the new object being created, and a stack trace showing where the
 duplication occurred.  <code>retracemem()</code> is used to indicate that a
 variable should be considered a copy of a previous variable (e.g. after
 subscripting).
 </p>
 <p>The messages can be turned off with <code>tracingState</code>.
 </p>
 <p>It is not possible to trace functions, as this would conflict with
 <code>trace</code> and it is not useful to trace <code>NULL</code>,
 environments, promises, weak references, or external pointer objects, as
 these are not duplicated.
 </p>
 <p>These functions are primitive.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A character string for identifying the object in the trace output (an
 address in hex enclosed in angle brackets), or <code>NULL</code> (invisibly).

 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>## Not run: 
 a &lt;- 1:10
 tracemem(a)
 ## b and a share memory
 b &lt;- a
 b[1] &lt;- 1
 untracemem(a)
 
 ## copying in lm
 d &lt;- stats::rnorm(10)
 tracemem(d)
 lm(d ~ a+log(b))
 
 ## f is not a copy and is not traced
 f &lt;- d[-1]
 f+1
 ## indicate that f should be traced as a copy of d
 retracemem(f, retracemem(d))
 f+1
 
 ## End(Not run)</pre>
