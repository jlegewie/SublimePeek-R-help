 <h2>Wildcard Expansion on File Paths</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Function to do wildcard expansion (also known as &lsquo;globbing&rsquo;) on
 file paths.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 Sys.glob(paths, dirmark = FALSE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>paths</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character vector of patterns for relative or absolute
 filepaths.  Missing values will be ignored.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>dirmark</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical: should matches to directories from patterns
 that do not already end in <code>/</code>
 have a slash appended?  May not be supported on all platforms.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>This expands wildcards in file paths.  For precise details, see your
 system's documentation on the <code>glob</code> system call.  There is a
 POSIX 1003.2 standard (see
 <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/glob.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/glob.html</a>)
 but some OSes will go beyond this.  The <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> implementation will always
 do tilde expansion.
 </p>
 <p>All systems should interpret <code>*</code> (match zero or more characters),
 <code>?</code> (match a single character) and (probably) <code>[</code> (begin a
 character class or range).  If a filename starts with <code>.</code> this
 must be matched explicitly.  By default paths ending in <code>/</code> will
 be accepted and matched only to directories.
 </p>
 <p>The rest of these details are indicative (and based on the POSIX
 standard).
 </p>
 <p><code>[</code> begins a character class.  If the first character in
 <code>[...]</code> is not <code>!</code>, this is a character class which matches
 a single character against any of the characters specified.  The class
 cannot be empty, so <code>]</code> can be included provided it is first.  If
 the first character is <code>!</code>, the character class matches a single
 character which is <EM>none</EM> of the specified characters.
 </p>
 <p>Character classes can include ranges such as <code>[A-Z]</code>: include
 <code>-</code> as a character by having it first or last in a class.  (The
 interpretation of ranges should be locale-specific, so the example is
 not a good idea in an Estonian locale.)
 </p>
 <p>One can remove the special meaning of <code>?</code>, <code>*</code>  and
 <code>[</code> by preceding them by a backslash (except within a
 character class).
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A character vector of matched file paths.  The order is
 system-specific (but in the order of the elements of <code>paths</code>): it
 is normally collated in either the current locale or in byte (ASCII)
 order; however, on Windows collation is in the order of Unicode
 points.
 </p>
 <p>Directory errors are normally ignored, so the matches are to
 accessible file paths (but not necessarily accessible files).
