 <h2>Install Packages from Repositories or Local Files</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from
 local files.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 install.packages(pkgs, lib, repos = getOption("repos"),
                  contriburl = contrib.url(repos, type),
                  method, available = NULL, destdir = NULL,
                  dependencies = NA, type = getOption("pkgType"),
                  configure.args = getOption("configure.args"),
                  configure.vars = getOption("configure.vars"),
                  clean = FALSE, Ncpus = getOption("Ncpus", 1L),
                  libs_only = FALSE, INSTALL_opts, ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>pkgs</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character vector of the names of packages whose
 current versions should be downloaded from the repositories.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>repos = NULL</code>, a character vector of file paths of
 &lsquo;<span class="file">.tar.gz</span>&rsquo; files.  These can be source archives or binary
 package archive files (as created by <CODE>R CMD build --binary</CODE>).
 On a CRAN build of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> for Mac OS X these can be &lsquo;<span class="file">.tgz</span>&rsquo; files
 containing binary package archives.
 Tilde-expansion will be done on the file paths.
 </p>
 <p>If this is missing or a zero-length character vector, a listbox of
 available packages is presented where possible in an interactive <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 session.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>lib</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>character vector giving the library directories where to
 install the packages.  Recycled as needed.  If missing, defaults to
 the first element of <code>.libPaths()</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>repos</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>character vector, the base URLs of the repositories
 to use, e.g., the URL of a CRAN mirror such as
 <code>"http://cran.us.r-project.org"</code>.
 </p>
 <p>Can be <code>NULL</code> to install from local files
 (with extension &lsquo;<span class="file">.tar.gz</span>&rsquo; for source packages).
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>contriburl</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>URL(s) of the contrib sections of the repositories.  Use this
 argument only if your repository mirror is incomplete, e.g., because
 you burned only the &lsquo;<span class="file">contrib</span>&rsquo; section on a CD.  Overrides
 argument <code>repos</code>.  As with <code>repos</code>, can also be <code>NULL</code>
 to install from local files.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>download method, see <code>download.file</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>available</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>an object as returned by <code>available.packages</code>
 listing packages available at the repositories, or <code>NULL</code> when
 the function makes an internal call to <code>available.packages</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>destdir</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>directory where downloaded packages are stored.  If it is
 <code>NULL</code> (the default) a subdirectory
 <code>downloaded_packages</code> of the session temporary
 directory will be used (and the files will be deleted
 at the end of the session). 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>dependencies</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical indicating to also install uninstalled
 packages which these packages depend on/link to/import/suggest
 (and so on recursively).  Not used if <code>repos = NULL</code>.
 Can also be a character vector, a subset of
 <code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests", "Enhances")</code>.
 </p>
 <p>Only supported if <code>lib</code> is of length one (or missing),
 so it is unambiguous where to install the dependent packages.  If
 this is not the case it is ignored, with a warning.
 </p>
 <p>The default, <code>NA</code>, means
 <code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")</code>.
 </p>
 <p><code>TRUE</code> means (as from <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.15.0) to use
 <code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests")</code> for
 <code>pkgs</code> and
 <code>c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")</code> for added dependencies:
 this installs all the packages needed to run <code>pkgs</code>, their
 examples, tests and vignettes (if the package author specified them
 correctly).
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character, indicating the type of package to download and
 install.
 </p>
 <p>Possible values are <code>"source"</code>, <code>"mac.binary.leopard"</code> and
 <code>"win.binary"</code>: the binary types can be listed and downloaded
 but not installed on other platforms.
 </p>
 <p>The default is the appropriate binary type on Windows and on
 the CRAN binary Mac OS X distribution, otherwise <code>"source"</code>.
 For the platforms where binary packages are the default, an
 alternative is <code>"both"</code> which means &lsquo;try binary if
 available, otherwise try source&rsquo;.  (This will only choose the
 binary package if its version number is no older than the source
 version.)
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>configure.args</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>(not used on Windows) a character vector or a named list.  If a
 character vector with no names is supplied, the elements are
 concatenated into a single string (separated by a space) and used as
 the value for the <span class="option">--configure-args</span> flag in the call to
 <CODE>R CMD INSTALL</CODE>.  If the character vector has names these
 are assumed to identify values for <span class="option">--configure-args</span> for
 individual packages.  This allows one to specify settings for an
 entire collection of packages which will be used if any of those
 packages are to be installed.  (These settings can therefore be
 re-used and act as default settings.)
 </p>
 <p>A named list can be used also to the same effect, and that
 allows multi-element character strings for each package
 which are concatenated to a single string to be used as the
 value for <span class="option">--configure-args</span>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>configure.vars</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>(not used on Windows) analogous to <code>configure.args</code> for flag
 <span class="option">--configure-vars</span>, which is used to set environment variables
 for the <CODE>configure</CODE> run. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>clean</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical value indicating whether to specify
 to add the <span class="option">--clean</span> flag to the call to
 <CODE>R CMD INSTALL</CODE>.
 This is sometimes used to perform additional operations at the end
 of the package installation in addition to removing intermediate files.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>Ncpus</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>The number of parallel processes to use for a parallel
 install of more than one source package.  Values greater than one
 are supported if the <CODE>make</CODE> command specified by
 <code>Sys.getenv("MAKE", "make")</code> accepts argument <code>-k -j
     <VAR>Ncpus</VAR></code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>libs_only</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>a logical value: should the <span class="option">--libs-only</span> option be used to
 install only additional sub-architectures?  (See also
 <code>INSTALL_opts</code>.)  This can also be used on Windows to install
 just the DLL(s) from a binary package, e.g. to add 64-bit DLLs to a
 32-bit install. 
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>INSTALL_opts</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>an optional character vector of additional option(s) to be passed to
 <CODE>R CMD INSTALL</CODE> for a source package install.  E.g.
 <code>c("--html", "--no-multiarch")</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>Arguments to be passed to <code>download.file</code>, or to the
 functions for binary installs on Mac OS X and Windows (which accept
 an argument <code>"lock"</code>: the the section on &lsquo;Locking&rsquo;).
 </p>
 </td></tr>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p><font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> packages are primarily distributed as <EM>source</EM> packages, but
 <EM>binary</EM> packages (a packaging up of the installed package) are
 also supported, and the type most commonly used on Windows and from
 the CRAN distribution for Mac OS X.  This function can install either
 type where supported, either by downloading a file from a repository
 or from a local file.  The default type is given by
 <code>getOption("pkgType")</code>: this defaults to <code>"source"</code>
 apart from under Windows or a CRAN binary distribution for Mac OS X.
 </p>
 <p>This is the main function to install packages. It takes
 a vector of names and a destination library, downloads the packages
 from the repositories and installs them.  (If the library is omitted
 it defaults to the first directory in <code>.libPaths()</code>, with a
 message if there is more than one.)  If <code>lib</code> is omitted or is of
 length one and is not a (group) writable directory, the code offers
 to create a personal library tree (the first element of
 <code>Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")</code>) and install there.
 </p>
 <p>For source packages from a repository an attempt is made to
 install the packages in an order that respects their dependencies.
 This does assume that all the entries in <code>lib</code> are on the default
 library path for installs (set by <span class="env">R_LIBS</span>).
 </p>
 <p>You are advised to run <code>update.packages</code> before
 <code>install.packages</code> to ensure that any already installed
 dependencies have their latest versions.
 </p>
 <p>Argument <code>libs_only = TRUE</code> is supported for source installs and for
 Windows binary installs.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>Invisible <code>NULL</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Locking</h3>
 
 
 <p>There are various options for locking: these differ between source and
 binary installs.
 </p>
 <p>By default for a source install, the library directory is
 &lsquo;locked&rsquo; by creating a directory &lsquo;<span class="file">00LOCK</span>&rsquo; within it.  This
 has two purposes: it prevents any other process installing into that
 library concurrently, and is used to store any previous version of the
 package to restore on error.  A finer-grained locking is provided by
 the option <span class="option">--pkglock</span> which creates a separate lock for each
 package: this allows enough freedom for parallel
 installation.  Per-package locking is the default when installing a
 single package, and for multiple packages when <code>Ncpus &gt; 1L</code>.
 Finally locking (and restoration on error) can be suppressed by
 <span class="option">--no-lock</span>.
 
 </p>
 <p>For a Mac OS X or Windows binary install, no locking is done by
 default.  Setting argument <code>lock</code> to <code>TRUE</code> (it defaults to
 the value of <code>getOption("install.lock", FALSE)</code>) will use
 per-directory locking as described for source installs: if the value
 is <code>"pkglock"</code> per-package locking will be used.
 </p>
 <p>If package locking is used on Windows with <code>libs_only = TRUE</code> and
 the installation fails, the package will be restored to its previous
 state.
 </p>
 <p>Note that it is possible for the package installation to fail so badly
 that the lock directory is not removed: this inhibits any further
 installs to the library directory (or for <code>--pkglock</code>, of the
 package) until the lock directory is removed manually.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Parallel installs</h3>
 
 
 <p>Parallel installs are attempted if <code>pkgs</code> has length greater than
 one and <code>Ncpus &gt; 1</code>.  It makes use of a parallel <CODE>make</CODE>,
 so the <code>make</code> specified (default <CODE>make</CODE>) when <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> was
 built must be capable of supporting <code>make -j <VAR>n</VAR></code>: GNU make
 and <CODE>dmake</CODE> do, but FreeBSD and Solaris <CODE>make</CODE> do not:
 if necessary environment variable <span class="env">MAKE</span> can be set for the
 current session to select a suitable <CODE>make</CODE>.
 </p>
 <p><code>install.packages</code> needs to be able to compute all the
 dependencies of <code>pkgs</code> from <code>available</code>, including if one
 element of <code>pkgs</code> depends indirectly on another.  This means that
 if for example you are installing <acronym><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></acronym> packages which depend
 on Bioconductor packages which in turn depend on <acronym><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></acronym>
 packages, <code>available</code> needs to cover both <acronym><span class="acronym">CRAN</span></acronym> and
 Bioconductor packages.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p>Some binary distributions of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> have <code>INSTALL</code> in a separate
 bundle, e.g. an <code>R-devel</code> RPM.  <code>install.packages</code> will
 give an error if called with <code>type = "source"</code> on such a system.
 </p>
 <p>Some binary distributions of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> can be installed on a machine without the
 tools needed to install packages: the remedy is to do a complete
 install of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> which should bring in all those tools as dependencies.
