 <h2>Delete Files and Directories</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>unlink</code> deletes the file(s) or directories specified by <code>x</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>unlink(x, recursive = FALSE, force = FALSE)</pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a character vector with the names of the file(s) or
 directories to be deleted.
 Wildcards (normally &lsquo;<span class="file">*</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span class="file">?</span>&rsquo;) are allowed.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>recursive</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical.  Should directories be deleted recursively?</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>force</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical.  Should permissions be changed (if possible) to
 allow the file or directory to be removed?</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>Tilde-expansion (see <code>path.expand</code>) is done on <code>x</code>.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>recursive = FALSE</code> directories are not deleted,
 not even empty ones.
 </p>
 <p>On most platforms &lsquo;file&rsquo; includes symbolic links, fifos and
 sockets.  Prior to <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.15.0 <code>unlink(x, recursive = TRUE)</code> would
 delete the contents of a directory target of a symbolic link: it now
 only deletes the symbolic link (as <code>unlink(x, recursive = FALSE)</code>
 always has).
 </p>
 <p>Wildcard expansion is done by the internal code of
 <code>Sys.glob</code>.  Wildcards never match a leading &lsquo;<span class="file">.</span>&rsquo; in
 the filename, and files &lsquo;<span class="file">.</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span class="file">..</span>&rsquo; will never be
 considered for deletion.
 Wildcards will only be expanded if the system supports it.  Most
 systems will support not only &lsquo;<span class="file">*</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span class="file">?</span>&rsquo; but also character
 classes such as &lsquo;<span class="file">[a-z]</span>&rsquo; (see the <CODE>man</CODE> pages for the system
 call <code>glob</code> on your OS).  The metacharacters <code>* ? [</code> can
 occur in Unix filenames, and this makes it difficult to use
 <code>unlink</code> to delete such files (see <code>file.remove</code>),
 although escaping the metacharacters by backslashes usually works.  If
 a metacharacter matches nothing it is considered as a literal
 character.
 </p>
 <p><code>recursive = TRUE</code> might not be supported on all platforms, when it
 will be ignored, with a warning: however there are no known current
 examples.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>0</code> for success, <code>1</code> for failure, invisibly.
 Not deleting a non-existent file is not a failure, nor is being unable
 to delete a directory if <code>recursive = FALSE</code>.  However, missing
 values in <code>x</code> are regarded as failures.
