 <h2>Graphical Input</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Reads the position of the graphics cursor when the (first) mouse
 button is pressed.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 locator(n = 512, type = "n", ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>n</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the maximum number of points to locate.  Valid values start
 at 1.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>One of <code>"n"</code>, <code>"p"</code>, <code>"l"</code> or
 <code>"o"</code>. If <code>"p"</code> or <code>"o"</code> the points are
 plotted; if <code>"l"</code>  or <code>"o"</code> they are joined by lines.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>additional graphics parameters used if <code>type != "n"</code>
 for plotting the locations.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>locator</code> is only supported on screen devices such as
 <code>X11</code>, <code>windows</code> and <code>quartz</code>.  On other devices the
 call will do nothing.
 </p>
 <p>Unless the process is terminated prematurely by the user (see below)
 at most <code>n</code> positions are determined.
 </p>
 <p>For the usual <code>X11</code> device the identification process is
 terminated by pressing any mouse button other than the first.
 For the <code>quartz</code> device the process is terminated by
 pressing the <code>ESC</code> key.
 </p>
 <p>The current graphics parameters apply just as if <code>plot.default</code>
 has been called with the same value of <code>type</code>. The plotting of
 the points and lines is subject to clipping, but locations outside the
 current clipping rectangle will be returned.
 </p>
 <p>On most devices which support <code>locator</code>, successful selection of
 a point is indicated by a bell sound unless
 <code>options(locatorBell=FALSE)</code> has been set.
 </p>
 <p>If the window is resized or hidden and then exposed before the input
 process has terminated, any lines or points drawn by <code>locator</code>
 will disappear.  These will reappear once the input process has
 terminated and the window is resized or hidden and exposed again.
 This is because the points and lines drawn by <code>locator</code> are not
 recorded in the device's display list until the input process has
 terminated.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A list containing <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> components which are the
 coordinates of the identified points in the user coordinate system,
 i.e., the one specified by <code>par("usr")</code>.
