 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>description</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character string.  A description of the connection:
 see &lsquo;Details&rsquo;.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>open</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character.  A description of how to open the connection
 (if it should be opened initially).  See section &lsquo;Modes&rsquo; for
 possible values.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>blocking</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical.  See the &lsquo;Blocking&rsquo; section.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>encoding</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>The name of the encoding to be used.  See the
 &lsquo;Encoding&rsquo; section.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>raw</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical.  If true, a &lsquo;raw&rsquo; interface is used which
 will be more suitable for arguments which are not regular files,
 e.g. character devices.  This suppresses the check for a compressed
 file when opening for text-mode reading, and asserts that the
 &lsquo;file&rsquo; may not be seekable.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>compression</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>integer in 0&ndash;9.  The amount of compression to be
 applied when writing, from none to maximal available.  For
 <code>xzfile</code> can also be negative: see the &lsquo;Compression&rsquo;
 section.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>timeout</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>numeric: the timeout (in seconds) to be used for this
 connection.  Beware that some OSes may treat very large values as
 zero: however the POSIX standard requires values up to 31 days to be
 supported.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>filename</code></td>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The first nine functions create connections.  By default the
 connection is not opened (except for <code>socketConnection</code>), but may
 be opened by setting a non-empty value of argument <code>open</code>.
 </p>
 <p>For <code>file</code> the description is a path to the file to be opened or
 a complete URL (when it is the same as calling <code>url</code>), or
 <code>""</code> (the default) or <code>"clipboard"</code> (see the
 &lsquo;Clipboard&rsquo; section).  Use <code>"stdin"</code> to refer to the
 C-level &lsquo;standard input&rsquo; of the process (which need not be
 connected to anything in a console or embedded version of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>, and is
 not in <code>RGui</code> on Windows).  See also <code>stdin()</code> for
 the subtly different R-level concept of <code>stdin</code>.
 </p>
 <p>For <code>url</code> the description is a complete URL, including scheme
 (such as <span class="samp">http://</span>, <span class="samp">ftp://</span> or <span class="samp">file://</span>).  Proxies
 can be specified for HTTP and FTP <code>url</code> connections: see
 <code>download.file</code>.
 </p>
 <p>For <code>gzfile</code> the description is the path to a file compressed by
 <CODE>gzip</CODE>: it can also open for reading uncompressed files and
 (as from <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.10.0) those compressed by <CODE>bzip2</CODE>, <CODE>xz</CODE>
 or <CODE>lzma</CODE>.
 </p>
 <p>For <code>bzfile</code> the description is the path to a file compressed by
 <CODE>bzip2</CODE>.
 </p>
 <p>For <code>xzfile</code> the description is the path to a file compressed by
 <CODE>xz</CODE> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz</a>) or (for reading
 only) <CODE>lzma</CODE> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA</a>).
 </p>
 <p><code>unz</code> reads (only) single files within zip files, in binary mode.
 The description is the full path to the zip file, with &lsquo;<span class="file">.zip</span>&rsquo;
 extension if required.
 </p>
 <p>For <code>pipe</code> the description is the command line to be piped to or
 from.  This is run in a shell, on Windows that specified by the
 <span class="env">COMSPEC</span> environment variable.
 </p>
 <p>For <code>fifo</code> the description is the path of the fifo.  (Windows
 does not have fifos, so attempts to use this function there are an
 error.  It was possible to use <code>file</code> with fifos prior to <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 2.10.0, but <code>raw=TRUE</code> is now required for reading, and
 <code>fifo</code> was always the documented interface.) 
 </p>
 <p>All platforms support <code>file</code>, <code>pipe</code>, <code>gzfile</code>,
 <code>bzfile</code>, <code>xzfile</code>, <code>unz</code> and <code>url("file://")</code>
 connections.  The other connections may be partially implemented or
 not implemented at all.  (They do work on most Unix platforms, and all
 but <code>fifo</code> on Windows.)
 </p>
 <p>The intention is that <code>file</code> and <code>gzfile</code> can be used
 generally for text input (from files and URLs) and binary input
 respectively.
 </p>
 <p><code>open</code>, <code>close</code> and <code>seek</code> are generic functions: the
 following applies to the methods relevant to connections.
 </p>
 <p><code>open</code> opens a connection.  In general functions using
 connections will open them if they are not open, but then close them
 again, so to leave a connection open call <code>open</code> explicitly.
 </p>
 <p><code>close</code> closes and destroys a connection.  This will happen
 automatically in due course (with a warning) if there is no longer an
 <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> object referring to the connection.
 </p>
 <p>A maximum of 128 connections can be allocated (not necessarily open)
 at any one time.  Three of these are pre-allocated (see
 <code>stdout</code>).   The OS will impose limits on the numbers of
 connections of various types, but these are usually larger than 125.
 </p>
 <p><code>flush</code> flushes the output stream of a connection open for
 write/append (where implemented, currently for file and clipboard
 connections, <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>).
 </p>
 <p>If for a <code>file</code> or <code>fifo</code> connection the description is
 <code>""</code>, the file/fifo is immediately opened (in <code>"w+"</code> mode
 unless <code>open = "w+b"</code> is specified) and unlinked from the file
 system.  This provides a temporary file/fifo to write to and then read
 from.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>file</code>, <code>pipe</code>, <code>fifo</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>gzfile</code>,
 <code>bzfile</code>, <code>xzfile</code>, <code>unz</code> and <code>socketConnection</code>
 return a connection object which inherits from class
 <code>"connection"</code> and has a first more specific class.
 </p>
 <p><code>isOpen</code> returns a logical value, whether the connection is
 currently open.
 </p>
 <p><code>isIncomplete</code> returns a logical value, whether the last read
 attempt was blocked, or for an output text connection whether there is
 unflushed output.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>URLs</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>url</code> and <code>file</code> support URL schemes <span class="samp">http://</span>,
 <span class="samp">ftp://</span> and <span class="samp">file://</span>.
 </p>
 <p>A note on <span class="samp">file://</span> URLs.  The most general form (from RFC1738) is
 <span class="samp">file://host/path/to/file</span>, but <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> only accepts the form with an
 empty <code>host</code> field referring to the local machine.
 </p>
 <p>On a Unix-alike, this is then <span class="samp">file:///path/to/file</span>, where
 <span class="samp">path/to/file</span> is relative to &lsquo;<span class="file">/</span>&rsquo;.  So although the third
 slash is strictly part of the specification not part of the path, this
 can be regarded as a way to specify the file &lsquo;<span class="file">/path/to/file</span>&rsquo;.  It
 is not possible to specify a relative path using a file URL.
 </p>
 <p>In this form the path is relative to the root of the filesystem, not a
 Windows concept.  The standard form on Windows is
 <span class="samp">file:///d:/R/repos</span>: for compatibility with earlier versions of
 <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> and Unix versions, any other form is parsed as <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> as <span class="samp">file://</span>
 plus <code>path_to_file</code>.  Also, backslashes are accepted within the
 path even though RFC1738 does not allow them.
 </p>
 <p>No attempt is made to decode an encoded URL: call
 <code>URLdecode</code> if necessary.
 </p>
 <p>Note that <span class="samp">https://</span> connections are not supported except on
 Windows.  There they are only supported if <span class="option">--internet2</span> or
 <code>setInternet2(TRUE)</code>
 was used (to make use of Internet Explorer internals), and then only
 if the certificate is considered to be valid.  With that option only,
 the <span class="samp">http://user:pass@site</span> notation for sites requiring
 authentication is also accepted.
 </p>
 <p>Contributed package <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RCurl"><span class="pkg">RCurl</span></a> provides more comprehensive facilities
 to download from URLs.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Modes</h3>
 
 
 <p>Possible values for the argument <code>open</code> are
 </p>
 
 <dl>
 <dt><code>"r"</code> or <code>"rt"</code></dt><dd><p>Open for reading in text mode.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>"w"</code> or <code>"wt"</code></dt><dd><p>Open for writing in text mode.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>"a"</code> or <code>"at"</code></dt><dd><p>Open for appending in text mode.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>"rb"</code></dt><dd><p>Open for reading in binary mode.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>"wb"</code></dt><dd><p>Open for writing in binary mode.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>"ab"</code></dt><dd><p>Open for appending in binary mode.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>"r+"</code>, <code>"r+b"</code></dt><dd><p>Open for reading and writing.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>"w+"</code>, <code>"w+b"</code></dt><dd><p>Open for reading and writing,
 truncating file initially.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>"a+"</code>, <code>"a+b"</code></dt><dd><p>Open for reading and appending.</p>
 </dd>
 </dl>
 
 <p>Not all modes are applicable to all connections: for example URLs can
 only be opened for reading.  Only file and socket connections can be
 opened for both reading and writing.  An unsupported mode is usually
 silently substituted.
 </p>
 <p>If a file or fifo is created on a Unix-alike, its permissions will be
 the maximal allowed by the current setting of <code>umask</code> (see
 <code>Sys.umask</code>).
 </p>
 <p>For many connections there is little or no difference between text and
 binary modes.  For file-like connections on Windows, translation of
 line endings (between LF and CRLF) is done in text mode only (but text
 read operations on connections such as <code>readLines</code>,
 <code>scan</code> and <code>source</code> work for any form of line
 ending).  Various <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> operations are possible in only one of the modes:
 for example <code>pushBack</code> is text-oriented and is only
 allowed on connections open for reading in text mode, and binary
 operations such as <code>readBin</code>, <code>load</code> and
 <code>save</code> operations can only be done on binary-mode
 connections.
 </p>
 <p>The mode of a connection is determined when actually opened, which is
 deferred if <code>open = ""</code> is given (the default for all but socket
 connections).  An explicit call to <code>open</code> can specify the mode,
 but otherwise the mode will be <code>"r"</code>.  (<code>gzfile</code>,
 <code>bzfile</code> and <code>xzfile</code> connections are exceptions, as the
 compressed file always has to be opened in binary mode and no
 conversion of line-endings is done even on Windows, so the default
 mode is interpreted as <code>"rb"</code>.)  Most operations that need write
 access or text-only or binary-only mode will override the default mode
 of a non-yet-open connection.
 </p>
 <p>Append modes need to be considered carefully for compressed-file
 connections.  They do <STRONG>not</STRONG> produce a single compressed stream
 on the file, but rather append a new compressed stream to the file.
 Readers (including <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>) may or may not read beyond end of the first
 stream: currently <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> does so for <code>gzfile</code>, <code>bzfile</code> and
 <code>xzfile</code> connections, but earlier versions did not.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Compression</h3>
 
 
 <p><font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> has for a long time supported <CODE>gzip</CODE> and <CODE>bzip2</CODE>
 compression, and support for <CODE>xz</CODE> compression (and read-only
 support for its precursor <code>lzma</code> compression) was added in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 2.10.0.
 </p>
 <p>For reading, the type of compression (if any) can be determined from
 the first few bytes of the file, and this is exploited as from <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 2.10.0.  Thus for <code>file(raw = FALSE)</code> connections, if <code>open</code> is
 <code>""</code>, <code>"r"</code> or <code>"rt"</code> the connection can read any of
 the compressed file types as well as uncompressed files.  (Using
 <code>"rb"</code> will allow compressed files to be read byte-by-byte.)
 Similarly, <code>gzfile</code> connections can read any of the forms of
 compression and uncompressed files in any read mode.
 </p>
 <p>(The type of compression is determined when the connection is created
 if <code>open</code> is unspecified and a file of that name exists.  If the
 intention is to open the connection to write a file with a
 <EM>different</EM> form of compression under that name, specify
 <code>open = "w"</code> when the connection is created or
 <code>unlink</code> the file before creating the connection.)
 </p>
 <p>For write-mode connections, <code>compress</code> specifies now hard the
 compressor works to minimize the file size, and higher values need
 more CPU time and more working memory (up to ca 800Mb for
 <code>xzfile(compress = 9)</code>).  For <code>xzfile</code> negative values of
 <code>compress</code> correspond to adding the <CODE>xz</CODE> argument
 <span class="option">-e</span>: this takes more time (double?) to compress but may
 achieve (slightly) better compression.  The default (<code>6</code>) has
 good compression and modest (100Mb memory usage): but if you are using
 <code>xz</code> compression you are probably looking for high compression.
 </p>
 <p>Choosing the type of compression involves tradeoffs: <CODE>gzip</CODE>,
 <CODE>bzip2</CODE> and <CODE>xz</CODE> are successively less widely supported,
 need more resources for both compression and decompression, and
 achieve more compression (although individual files may buck the
 general trend).  Typical experience is that <code>bzip2</code> compression
 is 15% better on text files than <code>gzip</code> compression, and
 <code>xz</code> with maximal compression 30% better.  The experience with
 <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> <code>save</code> files is similar, but on some large &lsquo;<span class="file">.rda</span>&rsquo;
 files <code>xz</code> compression is much better than the other two.  With
 current computers decompression times even with <code>compress = 9</code>
 are typically modest and reading compressed files is usually faster
 than uncompressed ones because of the reduction in disc activity.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Encoding</h3>
 
 
 <p>The encoding of the input/output stream of a connection can be
 specified by name in the same way as it would be given to
 <code>iconv</code>: see that help page for how to find out what
 encoding names are recognized on your platform.  Additionally,
 <code>""</code> and <code>"native.enc"</code> both mean the &lsquo;native&rsquo;
 encoding, that is the internal encoding of the current locale and
 hence no translation is done.
 </p>
 <p>Re-encoding only works for connections in text mode: reading from a
 connection with re-encoding specified in binary mode will read the
 stream of bytes, but mixing text and binary mode reads (e.g. mixing
 calls to <code>readLines</code> and <code>readChar</code>) is likely
 to lead to incorrect results.
 </p>
 <p>The encodings <code>"UCS-2LE"</code> and <code>"UTF-16LE"</code> are treated
 specially, as they are appropriate values for Windows &lsquo;Unicode&rsquo;
 text files.  If the first two bytes are the Byte Order Mark
 <code>0xFFFE</code> then these are removed as some implementations of
 <code>iconv</code> do not accept BOMs.  Note that whereas most
 implementations will handle BOMs using encoding <code>"UCS-2"</code> and
 choose the appropriate byte order, some (including earlier versions of
 <code>glibc</code>) will not.  There is a subtle distinction between
 <code>"UTF-16"</code> and <code>"UCS-2"</code> (see
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16/UCS-2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16/UCS-2</a>: the use of surrogate
 pairs is very rare so <code>"UCS-2LE"</code> is an appropriate first choice.
 </p>
 <p>Requesting a conversion that is not supported is an error, reported
 when the connection is opened.  Exactly what happens when the
 requested translation cannot be done for invalid input is in general
 undocumented.  On output the result is likely to be that up to the
 error, with a warning.  On input, it will most likely be all or some
 of the input up to the error.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Blocking</h3>
 
 
 <p>Whether or not the connection blocks can be specified for file, url
 (default yes) fifo and socket connections (default not).
 </p>
 <p>In blocking mode, functions using the connection do not return to the
 <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> evaluator until the read/write is complete.  In non-blocking mode,
 operations return as soon as possible, so on input they will return
 with whatever input is available (possibly none) and for output they
 will return whether or not the write succeeded.
 </p>
 <p>The function <code>readLines</code> behaves differently in respect of
 incomplete last lines in the two modes: see its help page.
 </p>
 <p>Even when a connection is in blocking mode, attempts are made to
 ensure that it does not block the event loop and hence the operation
 of GUI parts of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.  These do not always succeed, and the whole <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 process will be blocked during a DNS lookup on Unix, for example.
 </p>
 <p>Most blocking operations on HTTP/FTP URLs and on sockets are subject to the
 timeout set by <code>options("timeout")</code>.  Note that this is a timeout
 for no response, not for the whole operation.  The timeout is set at
 the time the connection is opened (more precisely, when the last
 connection of that type &ndash; <span class="samp">http:</span>, <span class="samp">ftp:</span> or socket &ndash; was
 opened).
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Fifos</h3>
 
 
 <p>Fifos default to non-blocking.  That follows S version 4 and is
 probably most natural, but it does have some implications.  In
 particular, opening a non-blocking fifo connection for writing (only)
 will fail unless some other process is reading on the fifo.
 </p>
 <p>Opening a fifo for both reading and writing (in any mode: one can only
 append to fifos) connects both sides of the fifo to the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> process,
 and provides an similar facility to <code>file()</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Clipboard</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>file</code> can be used with <code>description = "clipboard"</code>
 in mode <code>"r"</code> only.  This reads the X11 primary selection (see
 <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/clipboards-spec/clipboards-latest.txt">http://standards.freedesktop.org/clipboards-spec/clipboards-latest.txt</a>),
 which can also be specified as <code>"X11_primary"</code> and the secondary
 selection as <code>"X11_secondary"</code>.  On most systems the clipboard
 selection (that used by &lsquo;Copy&rsquo; from an &lsquo;Edit&rsquo; menu) can
 be specified as <code>"X11_clipboard"</code>.
 </p>
 <p>When a clipboard is opened for reading, the contents are immediately
 copied to internal storage in the connection.
 </p>
 <p>Unix users wishing to <EM>write</EM> to one of the selections may be
 able to do so via <code>xclip</code>
 (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/</a>), for example by
 <code>pipe("xclip -i", "w")</code> for the primary selection.
 </p>
 <p>Mac OS X users can use <code>pipe("pbpaste")</code> and
 <code>pipe("pbcopy", "w")</code> to read from and write to that system's
 clipboard.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p><font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>'s connections are modelled on those in S version 4 (see Chambers,
 1998).  However <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> goes well beyond the S model, for example in output
 text connections and URL, compressed and socket connections.
 </p>
 <p>The default open mode in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> is <code>"r"</code> except for socket connections.
 This differs from S, where it is the equivalent of <code>"r+"</code>,
 known as <code>"*"</code>.
 </p>
 <p>On (rare) platforms where <code>vsnprintf</code> does not return the needed length
 of output there is a 100,000 byte output limit on the length of
 line for text output on <code>fifo</code>, <code>gzfile</code>, <code>bzfile</code> and
 <code>xzfile</code> connections: longer lines will be truncated with a
 warning.
 </p>
