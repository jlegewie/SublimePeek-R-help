 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>Character strings in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> can be declared to be in <code>"latin1"</code> or
 <code>"UTF-8"</code> or <code>"bytes"</code>.  These declarations can be read by
 <code>Encoding</code>, which will return a character vector of values
 <code>"latin1"</code>, <code>"UTF-8"</code> <code>"bytes"</code> or <code>"unknown"</code>, or
 set, when <code>value</code> is recycled as needed and other values are
 silently treated as <code>"unknown"</code>.  ASCII strings will never be
 marked with a declared encoding, since their representation is the
 same in all supported encodings.  Strings marked as <code>"bytes"</code> are
 intended to be non-ASCII strings which should be manipulated as bytes,
 and never converted to a character encoding.
 </p>
 <p><code>enc2native</code> and <code>enc2utf8</code> convert elements of character
 vectors to the native encoding or UTF-8 respectively, taking any
 marked encoding into account.  They are primitive functions,
 designed to do minimal copying.
 </p>
 <p>There are other ways for character strings to acquire a declared
 encoding apart from explicitly setting it (and these have changed as
 <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> has evolved).  Functions <code>scan</code>,
 <code>read.table</code>, <code>readLines</code>, and
 <code>parse</code> have an <code>encoding</code> argument that is used to
 declare encodings, <code>iconv</code> declares encodings from its
 <code>from</code> argument, and console input in suitable locales is also
 declared.  <code>intToUtf8</code> declares its output as
 <code>"UTF-8"</code>, and output text connections (see
 <code>textConnection</code>) are marked if running in a
 suitable locale.  Under some circumstances (see its help page)
 <code>source(encoding=)</code> will mark encodings of character
 strings it outputs.
 </p>
 <p>Most character manipulation functions will set the encoding on output
 strings if it was declared on the corresponding input.  These include
 <code>chartr</code>, <code>strsplit(useBytes = FALSE)</code>,
 <code>tolower</code> and <code>toupper</code> as well as
 <code>sub(useBytes = FALSE)</code> and <code>gsub(useBytes =
   FALSE)</code>.  Note that such functions do not <EM>preserve</EM> the
 encoding, but if they know the input encoding and that the string has
 been successfully re-encoded (to the current encoding or UTF-8), they
 mark the output.
 </p>
 <p><code>substr</code> does preserve the encoding, and
 <code>chartr</code>, <code>tolower</code> and <code>toupper</code>
 preserve UTF-8 encoding on systems with Unicode wide characters.  With
 their <code>fixed</code> and <code>perl</code> options, <code>strsplit</code>,
 <code>sub</code> and <code>gsub</code> will give a marked UTF-8 result if
 any of the inputs are UTF-8.
 </p>
 <p><code>paste</code> and <code>sprintf</code> return elements marked
 as bytes if any of the corresponding inputs is marked as bytes, and 
 otherwise marked as UTF-8 of any of the inputs is marked as UTF-8.
 </p>
 <p><code>match</code>, <code>pmatch</code>, <code>charmatch</code>,
 <code>duplicated</code> and <code>unique</code> all match in UTF-8
 if any of the elements are marked as UTF-8.

 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>
 ## x is intended to be in latin1
 x &lt;- "fa\xE7ile"
 Encoding(x)
 Encoding(x) &lt;- "latin1"
 x
 xx &lt;- iconv(x, "latin1", "UTF-8")
 Encoding(c(x, xx))
 c(x, xx)
 Encoding(xx) &lt;- "bytes"
 xx # will be encoded in hex
 cat("xx = ", xx, "\n", sep = "")
