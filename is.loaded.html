 <h2>Foreign Function Interface</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Load or unload DLLs (also known as shared objects), and test whether a
 C function or Fortran subroutine is available.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 dyn.load(x, local = TRUE, now = TRUE, ...)
 dyn.unload(x)
 
 is.loaded(symbol, PACKAGE = "", type = "")
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a character string giving the pathname to a DLL, also known
 as a dynamic shared object.  (See &lsquo;Details&rsquo; for what these
 terms mean.)</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>local</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical value controlling whether the symbols in the
 DLL are stored in their own local table and not shared
 across DLLs, or added to the global symbol table.  Whether this has
 any effect is system-dependent.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>now</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical controlling whether all symbols are resolved (and
 relocated) immediately the library is loaded or deferred until they
 are used.  This control is useful for developers testing whether a
 library is complete and has all the necessary symbols, and for users
 to ignore missing symbols.  Whether this has any effect is system-dependent.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>other arguments for future expansion.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>symbol</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a character string giving a symbol name.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>PACKAGE</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>if supplied, confine the search for the <code>name</code> to
 the DLL given by this argument (plus the conventional extension,
 &lsquo;<span class="file">.so</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="file">.sl</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="file">.dll</span>&rsquo;, ...).  This is intended to
 add safety for packages, which can ensure by using this argument
 that no other package can override their external symbols.  Use
 <code>PACKAGE="base"</code> for symbols linked in to <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.  This is used in the
 same way as in <code>.C</code>, <code>.Call</code>,
 <code>.Fortran</code> and <code>.External</code> functions</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>The type of symbol to look for: can be any (<code>""</code>, the
 default), <code>"Fortran"</code>, <code>"Call"</code> or <code>"External"</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The objects <code>dyn.load</code> loads are called &lsquo;dynamically
 loadable libraries&rsquo; (abbreviated to &lsquo;DLL&rsquo; on all platforms
 except Mac OS X, which unfortunately uses the term for a different
 sort of sobject.  On Unix-alikes they are also called &lsquo;dynamic
 shared objects&rsquo; (&lsquo;DSO&rsquo;), or &lsquo;shared objects&rsquo; for
 short.  (The POSIX standards use &lsquo;executable object file&rsquo;, but
 no one else does.)
 </p>
 <p>See &lsquo;See Also&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Writing R Extensions&rsquo; and
 &lsquo;R Installation and Administration&rsquo; manuals for how to create
 and install a suitable DLL.
 </p>
 <p>Unfortunately a very few platforms (e.g. Compaq Tru64) do not handle
 the <code>PACKAGE</code> argument correctly, and may incorrectly find
 symbols linked into <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.
 </p>
 <p>The additional arguments to <code>dyn.load</code> mirror the different
 aspects of the mode argument to the <code>dlopen()</code> routine on POSIX
 systems.  They are available so that users can exercise greater control
 over the loading process for an individual library.  In general, the
 default values are appropriate and you should override them only if
 there is good reason and you understand the implications.
 </p>
 <p>The <code>local</code> argument allows one to control whether the symbols in
 the DLL being attached are visible to other DLLs.  While maintaining
 the symbols in their own namespace is good practice, the ability to
 share symbols across related &lsquo;chapters&rsquo; is useful in many
 cases.  Additionally, on certain platforms and versions of an
 operating system, certain libraries must have their symbols loaded
 globally to successfully resolve all symbols.
 </p>
 <p>One should be careful of the potential side-effect of using lazy
 loading via the <code>now</code> argument as <code>FALSE</code>.  If a routine is
 called that has a missing symbol, the process will terminate
 immediately.  The intended use is for library developers to call with
 value <code>TRUE</code> to check that all symbols are actually resolved and
 for regular users to call with <code>FALSE</code> so that missing symbols
 can be ignored and the available ones can be called.
 </p>
 <p>The initial motivation for adding these was to avoid such termination
 in the <code>_init()</code> routines of the Java virtual machine library.
 However, symbols loaded locally may not be (read probably) available
 to other DLLs.  Those added to the global table are available to all
 other elements of the application and so can be shared across two
 different DLLs.
 </p>
 <p>Some (very old) systems do not provide (explicit) support for
 local/global and lazy/eager symbol resolution.  This can be the source
 of subtle bugs.  One can arrange to have warning messages emitted when
 unsupported options are used.  This is done by setting either of the
 options <code>verbose</code> or <code>warn</code> to be non-zero via the
 <code>options</code> function.
 </p>
 <p>There is a short discussion of these additional arguments with some
 example code available at
 <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/duncan/R/dynload">http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/duncan/R/dynload</a>.

 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>The function <code>dyn.load</code> is used for its side effect which links
 the specified DLL to the executing <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> image.  Calls to <code>.C</code>,
 <code>.Call</code>, <code>.Fortran</code> and <code>.External</code> can then be used to
 execute compiled C functions or Fortran subroutines contained in the
 library.  The return value of <code>dyn.load</code> is an object of class
 <code>DLLInfo</code>.  See <code>getLoadedDLLs</code> for information about
 this class.
 </p>
 <p>The function <code>dyn.unload</code> unlinks the DLL.  Note that unloading a
 DLL and then re-loading a DLL of the same name may or may not work: on
 Solaris it uses the first version loaded.
 </p>
 <p><code>is.loaded</code> checks if the symbol name is loaded and hence
 available for use in <code>.C</code> or <code>.Fortran</code> or <code>.Call</code> or
 <code>.External</code>.  It will succeed if any one of the four calling
 functions would succeed in using the entry point unless <code>type</code> is
 specified.  (See <code>.Fortran</code> for how Fortran symbols are
 mapped.)
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Warning</h3>
 
 
 <p>Do not use <code>dyn.unload</code> on a DLL loaded by
 <code>library.dynam</code>: use <code>library.dynam.unload</code>.
 This is needed for system housekeeping.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>is.loaded</code> requires the name you would give to <code>.C</code> etc
 and <STRONG>not</STRONG> (as in S) that remapped by defunct functions
 <code>symbol.C</code> or <code>symbol.For</code>.
 </p>
 <p>The creation of DLLs and the runtime linking of them into executing
 programs is very platform dependent.  In recent years there has been
 some simplification in the process because the C subroutine call
 <code>dlopen</code> has become the POSIX standard for doing this.  Under
 Unix-alikes <code>dyn.load</code> uses the <code>dlopen</code> mechanism and
 should work on all platforms which support it.  On Windows it uses the
 standard mechanism (<code>LoadLibrary</code>) for loading DLLs.
 </p>
 <p>The original code for loading DLLs in Unix-alikes was provided by
 Heiner Schwarte.
