 Support for Parallel Computation
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Support for parallel computation, including random-number generation.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>This package is under development: a first version was released with
 <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.14.0.
 </p>
 <p>There is support for multiple RNG streams with the
 <span class="samp">"L'Ecuyer-CMRG"</span> RNG: see <code>nextRNGStream</code>.
 </p>
 <p>It contains functionality derived from and pretty much equivalent to
 that contained in packages <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multicore"><span class="pkg">multicore</span></a> (with some low-level
 functions renamed and not exported) and <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=snow"><span class="pkg">snow</span></a> (for socket
 clusters only, but MPI, NWS and PVM clusters generated by
 <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=snow"><span class="pkg">snow</span></a> are also supported).  This package also provides
 <code>makeForkCluster</code>.
 </p>
 <p>For a complete list of exported functions, use
 <code>library(help = "parallel")</code>.

 <p>Parallel computation involves launching worker processes: functions
 <code>psnice</code> and <code>pskill</code> in package <span class="pkg">tools</span>
 provide means to manage such processes.
