 <h2>Model Formulae</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>The generic function <code>formula</code> and its specific methods provide a
 way of extracting formulae which have been included in other objects.
 </p>
 <p><code>as.formula</code> is almost identical, additionally preserving
 attributes when <code>object</code> already inherits from
 <code>"formula"</code>.  The default value of the <code>env</code> argument is
 used only when the formula would otherwise lack an environment.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 formula(x, ...)
 as.formula(object, env = parent.frame())
 
 ## S3 method for class 'formula'
 print(x, showEnv = !identical(e, .GlobalEnv), ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The models fit by, e.g., the <code>lm</code> and <code>glm</code> functions
 are specified in a compact symbolic form.
 The <code>~</code> operator is basic in the formation of such models.
 An expression of the form <code>y ~ model</code> is interpreted
 as a specification that the response <code>y</code> is modelled
 by a linear predictor specified symbolically by <code>model</code>.
 Such a model consists of a series of terms separated
 by <code>+</code> operators.
 The terms themselves consist of variable and factor
 names separated by <code>:</code> operators.
 Such a term is interpreted as the interaction of
 all the variables and factors appearing in the term.
 </p>
 <p>In addition to <code>+</code> and <code>:</code>, a number of other operators are
 useful in model formulae.  The <code>*</code> operator denotes factor
 crossing: <code>a*b</code> interpreted as <code>a+b+a:b</code>.  The <code>^</code>
 operator indicates crossing to the specified degree.  For example
 <code>(a+b+c)^2</code> is identical to <code>(a+b+c)*(a+b+c)</code> which in turn
 expands to a formula containing the main effects for <code>a</code>,
 <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> together with their second-order interactions.
 The <code>%in%</code> operator indicates that the terms on its left are
 nested within those on the right.  For example <code>a + b %in% a</code>
 expands to the formula <code>a + a:b</code>.  The <code>-</code> operator removes
 the specified terms, so that <code>(a+b+c)^2 - a:b</code> is identical to
 <code>a + b + c + b:c + a:c</code>.  It can also used to remove the
 intercept term: when fitting a linear model <code>y ~ x - 1</code> specifies
 a line through the origin.  A model with no intercept can be also
 specified as <code>y ~ x + 0</code> or <code>y ~ 0 + x</code>.
 </p>
 <p>While formulae usually involve just variable and factor
 names, they can also involve arithmetic expressions.
 The formula <code>log(y) ~ a + log(x)</code> is quite legal.
 When such arithmetic expressions involve
 operators which are also used symbolically
 in model formulae, there can be confusion between
 arithmetic and symbolic operator use.
 </p>
 <p>To avoid this confusion, the function <code>I()</code>
 can be used to bracket those portions of a model
 formula where the operators are used in their
 arithmetic sense.  For example, in the formula
 <code>y ~ a + I(b+c)</code>, the term <code>b+c</code> is to be
 interpreted as the sum of <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.
 </p>
 <p>Variable names can be quoted by backticks <code>`like this`</code> in
 formulae, although there is no guarantee that all code using formulae
 will accept such non-syntactic names.
 </p>
 <p>Most model-fitting functions accept formulae with right-hand-side
 including the function <code>offset</code> to indicate terms with a
 fixed coefficient of one.  Some functions accept other
 &lsquo;specials&rsquo; such as <code>strata</code> or <code>cluster</code> (see the
 <code>specials</code> argument of <code>terms.formula)</code>.
 </p>
 <p>There are two special interpretations of <code>.</code> in a formula.  The
 usual one is in the context of a <code>data</code> argument of model
 fitting functions and means &lsquo;all columns not otherwise in the
 formula&rsquo;: see <code>terms.formula</code>.  In the context of
 <code>update.formula</code>, <B>only</B>, it means &lsquo;what was
 previously in this part of the formula&rsquo;.
 </p>
 <p>When <code>formula</code> is called on a fitted model object, either a
 specific method is used (such as that for class <code>"nls"</code>) or the
 default method.  The default first looks for a <code>"formula"</code>
 component of the object (and evaluates it), then a <code>"terms"</code>
 component, then a <code>formula</code> parameter of the call (and evaluates
 its value) and finally a <code>"formula"</code> attribute.
 </p>
 <p>There is a <code>formula</code> method for data frames.  If there is only
 one column this forms the RHS with an empty LHS.  For more columns,
 the first column is the LHS of the formula and the remaining columns
 separated by <code>+</code> form the RHS.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>All the functions above produce an object of class <code>"formula"</code>
 which contains a symbolic model formula.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Environments</h3>
 
 
 <p>A formula object has an associated environment, and
 this environment (rather than the parent
 environment) is used by <code>model.frame</code> to evaluate variables
 that are not found in the supplied <code>data</code> argument.
 </p>
 <p>Formulas created with the <code>~</code> operator use the
 environment in which they were created.  Formulas created with
 <code>as.formula</code> will use the <code>env</code> argument for their
 environment.  Pre-existing formulas extracted with
 <code>as.formula</code> will only have their environment changed if
 <code>env</code> is given explicitly.
