 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>There are two basic classes of date/times.  Class <code>"POSIXct"</code>
 represents the (signed) number of seconds since the beginning of 1970
 (in the UTC timezone) as a numeric vector.  Class <code>"POSIXlt"</code> is
 a named list of vectors representing
 </p>
 
 <dl>
 <dt><code>sec</code></dt><dd><p>0&ndash;61: seconds</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>min</code></dt><dd><p>0&ndash;59: minutes</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>hour</code></dt><dd><p>0&ndash;23: hours</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>mday</code></dt><dd><p>1&ndash;31: day of the month</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>mon</code></dt><dd><p>0&ndash;11: months after the first of the year.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>year</code></dt><dd><p>years since 1900.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>wday</code></dt><dd><p>0&ndash;6 day of the week, starting on Sunday.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>yday</code></dt><dd><p>0&ndash;365: day of the year.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>isdst</code></dt><dd><p>Daylight Savings Time flag.  Positive if in
 force, zero if not, negative if unknown.</p>
 </dd>
 </dl>
 
 <p>Note that the internal list structure is somewhat hidden, as many
 methods, including <code>print()</code> or <code>str</code>, apply
 to the abstract date-time vector, as for <code>"POSIXct"</code>.
 The classes correspond to the POSIX/C99 constructs of &lsquo;calendar
 time&rsquo; (the <code>time_t</code> data type) and &lsquo;local time&rsquo; (or
 broken-down time, the <code>struct tm</code> data type), from which they
 also inherit their names.  The components of <code>"POSIXlt"</code> are
 integer vectors, except <code>sec</code>.
 </p>
 <p><code>"POSIXct"</code> is more convenient for including in data frames, and
 <code>"POSIXlt"</code> is closer to human-readable forms.  A virtual class
 <code>"POSIXt"</code> exists from which both of the classes inherit: it is
 used to allow operations such as subtraction to mix the two classes.
 Note that <code>length(x)</code> is the length of the corresponding
 (abstract) date/time vector, also in the <code>"POSIXlt"</code> case.
 </p>
 <p>Components <code>wday</code> and <code>yday</code> of <code>"POSIXlt"</code> are for
 information, and are not used in the conversion to calendar time.
 However, <code>isdst</code> is needed to distinguish times at the end of
 DST: typically 1am to 2am occurs twice, first in DST and then in
 standard time.  At all other times <code>isdst</code> can be deduced from
 the first six values, but the behaviour if it is set incorrectly is
 platform-dependent.
 
 
 </p>
 <p>Logical comparisons and limited arithmetic are available for both
 classes.  One can add or subtract a number of seconds from a date-time
 object, but not add two date-time objects.  Subtraction of two
 date-time objects is equivalent to using <code>difftime</code>.  Be
 aware that <code>"POSIXlt"</code> objects will be interpreted as being in
 the current timezone for these operations, unless a timezone has been
 specified.
 </p>
 <p><code>"POSIXlt"</code> objects will often have an attribute <code>"tzone"</code>,
 a character vector of length 3 giving the timezone name from the
 <span class="env">TZ</span> environment variable and the names of the base timezone
 and the alternate (daylight-saving) timezone.  Sometimes this may
 just be of length one, giving the timezone name.
 </p>
 <p><code>"POSIXct"</code> objects may also have an attribute <code>"tzone"</code>, a
 character vector of length one.  If set to a non-empty value, it will
 determine how the object is converted to class <code>"POSIXlt"</code> and in
 particular how it is printed.  This is usually desirable, but if you
 want to specify an object in a particular timezone but to be printed
 in the current timezone you may want to remove the <code>"tzone"</code>
 attribute (e.g. by <code>c(x)</code>).
 </p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the conversion is complicated by the operation of time
 zones and leap seconds (24 days have been 86401 seconds long so far:
 the times of the extra seconds are in the object <code>.leap.seconds</code>).
 The details of this are entrusted to the OS services where possible.
 This always covers the period 1970&ndash;2037, and on most machines
 back to 1902 (when time zones were in their infancy).  Outside
 the platform limits we use our own C code.  This uses the offset from
 GMT in use either for 1902 (when there was no DST) or that predicted
 for one of 2030 to 2037 (chosen so that the likely DST transition days
 are Sundays), and uses the alternate (daylight-saving) timezone only
 if <code>isdst</code> is positive or (if <code>-1</code>) if DST was predicted to
 be in operation in the 2030s on that day.  (There is no reason to
 suppose that the DST rules will remain the same in the future, and
 indeed the US legislated in 2005 to change its rules as from 2007,
 with a possible future reversion.)
 </p>
 <p>It seems that some rare systems use leap seconds, but most ignore
 them (as required by POSIX).  This is detected and corrected for at
 build time, so all <code>"POSIXct"</code> times used by <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> do not include
 leap seconds. (Conceivably this could be wrong if the system has
 changed since build time, just possibly by changing locales or the
 &lsquo;<span class="file">zoneinfo</span>&rsquo; database.)
 </p>
 <p>Using <code>c</code> on <code>"POSIXlt"</code> objects converts them to the
 current time zone, and on <code>"POSIXct"</code> objects drops any
 <code>"tzone"</code> attributes (even if they are all marked with the same
 time zone).
 </p>
 <p>A few times have specific issues.  First, the leap seconds are ignored,
 and real times such as <code>"2005-12-31 23:59:60"</code> are (probably)
 treated as the next second.  However, they will never be generated by
 <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>, and are unlikely to arise as input.  Second, on some OSes there is
 a problem in the POSIX/C99 standard with <code>"1969-12-31 23:59:59 UTC"</code>,
 which is <code>-1</code> in calendar time and that value is on those OSes
 also used as an error code.  Thus <code>as.POSIXct("1969-12-31
   23:59:59", format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "UTC")</code> may give
 <code>NA</code>, and hence <code>as.POSIXct("1969-12-31 23:59:59",
   tz = "UTC")</code> will give <code>"1969-12-31 23:59:00"</code>.  Other OSes
 (including the code used by <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> on Windows) report errors separately
 and so are able to handle that time as valid.
 </p>
 <p>The print methods respect <code>options("max.print")</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Sub-second Accuracy</h3>
 
 
 <p>Classes <code>"POSIXct"</code> and  <code>"POSIXlt"</code> are able to express
 fractions of a second.  (Conversion of fractions between the two forms
 may not be exact, but will have better than microsecond accuracy.)
 </p>
 <p>Fractional seconds are printed only if
 <code>options("digits.secs")</code> is set: see <code>strftime</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Warning</h3>
 
 
 <p>Some Unix-like systems (especially Linux ones) do not have environment
 variable <span class="env">TZ</span>
 set, yet have internal code that expects it (as does POSIX).  We have
 tried to work around this, but if you get unexpected results try
 setting <span class="env">TZ</span>.  See <code>Sys.timezone</code> for valid settings.
