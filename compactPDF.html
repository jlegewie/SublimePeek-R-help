 <h2>
 Compact PDF Files
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Re-save PDF files (especially vignettes) more compactly.
 Support function for <CODE>R CMD build --compact-vignettes</CODE>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 compactPDF(paths,
            qpdf = Sys.which(Sys.getenv("R_QPDF", "qpdf")),
            gs_cmd = Sys.getenv("R_GSCMD", ""),
            gs_quality = Sys.getenv("GS_QUALITY", "none"),
            gs_extras = character())
 
 ## S3 method for class 'compactPDF'
 format(x, ratio = 0.9, diff = 1e4, ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>paths</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A character vector of paths to PDF files, or a length-one
 character vector naming a directory, when all &lsquo;<span class="file">.pdf</span>&rsquo; files in
 that directory will be used.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>qpdf</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Character string giving the path to the <CODE>qpdf</CODE>
 command.  If empty, <CODE>qpdf</CODE> will not be used.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>gs_cmd</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Character string giving the path to the GhostScript
 executable, if that is to be used.  On Windows this is the path to
 &lsquo;<span class="file">gswin32c.exe</span>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<span class="file">gswin64c.exe</span>&rsquo;.  If <code>""</code>, the
 function will try to find a platform-specific path to GhostScript.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>gs_quality</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A character string indicating the quality required:
 the options are <code>"none"</code> (so GhostScript is not used),
 <code>"printer"</code> (300dpi), <code>"ebook"</code> (150dpi) and
 <code>"screen"</code> (72dpi).</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>gs_extras</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>An optional character vector of further options to be
 passed to GhostScript.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>An object of class <code>"compactPDF"</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>ratio, diff</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Limits for reporting: files are only reported whose
 sizes are reduced both by a factor of <code>ratio</code> and by
 <code>diff</code> bytes.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Further arguments to be passed to or from other methods.</p>
 </td></tr>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>This by default makes use of <CODE>qpdf</CODE>, available from
 <a href="http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/">http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/</a> (including as a Windows binary) and
 included with the CRAN Mac OS X distribution of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.  If <code>gs_cmd</code>
 is non-empty and <code>gs_quality != "none"</code>, GhostScript will used
 first, then <CODE>qpdf</CODE> if it is available.  If <code>gs_quality !=
   "none"</code> and <code>gs_cmd</code> is empty, an attempt will be made to find a
 GhostScript executable.
 </p>
 <p><CODE>qpdf</CODE> and/or <CODE>gs_cmd</CODE> are run on all PDF files found,
 and those which are reduced in size by at least 10% and 10Kb are
 replaced.
 </p>
 <p>The strategy of our use of <CODE>qpdf</CODE> is to (losslessly) compress
 both PDF streams and objects.  Ghostscript compresses streams and more
 (including downsampling and compressing embedded images) and
 consequently is much slower and may lose quality (but can also produce
 much smaller PDF files).  However, quality <code>"ebook"</code> is perfectly
 adequate for screen viewing and printing on laser printers.
 </p>
 <p>Where PDF files are changed they will become PDF version 1.5 files:
 these have been supported by Acrobat Reader since version 6 in 2003,
 so this is very unlikely to cause difficulties.
 </p>
 <p>Stream compression is what most often has large gains: <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>'s
 <code>pdf</code> device prior to <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.14.0 did not use it, and
 older vignette PDFs often benefit from being re-generated.  Most PDF
 documents are generated with object compression, but this does not
 seem to be the default for MiKTeX's <CODE>pdflatex</CODE>.  For some PDF
 files (and especially package vignettes), using GhostScript can
 dramatically reduce the space taken by embedded images (often screenshots).
 </p>
 <p>Where both Ghostscript and <CODE>qpdf</CODE> are selected (when
 <code>gs_quality != "none"</code> and both executables are found), they are
 run in that order and the size reductions apply to the total
 compression achieved.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>An object of class <code>c("compactPDF", "data.frame")</code>.
 This has two columns, the old and new sizes in bytes for the files
 that were changed.
 </p>
 <p>There are <code>format</code> and <code>print</code> methods: the latter passes
 <code>...</code> to the format method, so will accept <code>ratio</code> and
 <code>diff</code> arguments.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p>The external tools used may change in future releases.

 <p>Many other (and sometimes more effective) tools to compact PDF files
 are available, including Adobe Acrobat (not Reader).
