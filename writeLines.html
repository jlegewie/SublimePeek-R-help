 <h2>Write Lines to a Connection</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Write text lines to a connection.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 writeLines(text, con = stdout(), sep = "\n", useBytes = FALSE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>text</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A character vector</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>con</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A connection object or a character string.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>sep</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character.  A string to be written to the connection after
 each line of text.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>useBytes</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical.  See &lsquo;Details&rsquo;.</p>
 </td></tr>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>If the <code>con</code> is a character string, the function calls
 <code>file</code> to obtain a file connection which is opened for
 the duration of the function call.
 </p>
 <p>If the connection is open it is written from its current position.
 If it is not open, it is opened for the duration of the call in
 <code>"wt"</code> mode and then closed again.
 </p>
 <p>Normally <code>writeLines</code> is used with a text-mode  connection, and the
 default separator is converted to the normal separator for that
 platform (LF on Unix/Linux, CRLF on Windows).  For more control, open
 a binary connection and specify the precise value you want written to
 the file in <code>sep</code>.  For even more control, use
 <code>writeChar</code> on a binary connection.
 </p>
 <p><code>useBytes</code> is for expert use.  Normally (when false) character
 strings with marked encodings are converted to the current encoding
 before being passed to the connection (which might do further
 re-encoding).  <code>useBytes = TRUE</code> suppresses the re-encoding of
 marked strings so they are passed byte-by-byte to the connection:
 this can be useful when strings have already been re-encoded by
 e.g. <code>iconv</code>.  (It is invoked automatically for strings
 with marked encoding <code>"bytes"</code>.)
