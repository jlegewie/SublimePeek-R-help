 <h2>
 Fit Log-Linear Models by Iterative Proportional Scaling
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>This function provides a front-end to the standard function,
 <code>loglin</code>, to allow log-linear models to be specified and fitted
 in a manner similar to that of other fitting functions, such as
 <code>glm</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 loglm(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>formula</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>A linear model formula specifying the log-linear model.
 </p>
 <p>If the left-hand side is empty, the <code>data</code> argument is required
 and must be a (complete) array of frequencies.  In this case the
 variables on the right-hand side may be the names of the
 <code>dimnames</code> attribute of the frequency array, or may be the
 positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ... used as alternative names for the
 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... dimension (classifying factor).
 If the left-hand side is not empty it specifies a vector of
 frequencies.  In this case the data argument, if present, must be
 a data frame from which the left-hand side vector and the
 classifying factors on the right-hand side are (preferentially)
 obtained.  The usual abbreviation of a <code>.</code> to stand for &lsquo;all
 other variables in the data frame&rsquo; is allowed.  Any non-factors
 on the right-hand side of the formula are coerced to factor.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>Numeric array or data frame.  In the first case it specifies the
 array of frequencies; in then second it provides the data frame
 from which the variables occurring in the formula are
 preferentially obtained in the usual way.
 </p>
 <p>This argument may be the result of a call to <code>xtabs</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>subset</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>Specifies a subset of the rows in the data frame to be used.  The
 default is to take all rows.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>na.action</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>Specifies a method for handling missing observations.  The
 default is to fail if missing values are present.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>May supply other arguments to the function <code>loglm1</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr></table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>If the left-hand side of the formula is empty the <code>data</code> argument
 supplies the frequency array and the right-hand side of the
 formula is used to construct the list of fixed faces as required
 by <code>loglin</code>.  Structural zeros may be specified by giving a
 <code>start</code> argument with those entries set to zero, as described in
 the help information for <code>loglin</code>.
 </p>
 <p>If the left-hand side is not empty, all variables on the
 right-hand side are regarded as classifying factors and an array
 of frequencies is constructed.  If some cells in the complete
 array are not specified they are treated as structural zeros.
 The right-hand side of the formula is again used to construct the
 list of faces on which the observed and fitted totals must agree,
 as required by <code>loglin</code>.  Hence terms such as
 <code>a:b</code>, <code>a*b</code> and <code>a/b</code> are all equivalent.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>An object of class <code>"loglm"</code> conveying the results of the fitted
 log-linear model.  Methods exist for the generic functions <code>print</code>,
 <code>summary</code>, <code>deviance</code>, <code>fitted</code>, <code>coef</code>,
 <code>resid</code>, <code>anova</code> and <code>update</code>, which perform the expected
 tasks.  Only log-likelihood ratio tests are allowed using <code>anova</code>.
 </p>
 <p>The deviance is simply an alternative name for the log-likelihood
 ratio statistic for testing the current model within a saturated
 model, in accordance with standard usage in generalized linear
 models.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Warning</h3>
 
 
 <p>If structural zeros are present, the calculation of degrees of
 freedom may not be correct.  <code>loglin</code> itself takes no action to
 allow for structural zeros.  <code>loglm</code> deducts one degree of
 freedom for each structural zero, but cannot make allowance for
 gains in error degrees of freedom due to loss of dimension in the
 model space.  (This would require checking the rank of the
 model matrix, but since iterative proportional scaling methods
 are developed largely to avoid constructing the model matrix
 explicitly, the computation is at least difficult.)
 </p>
 <p>When structural zeros (or zero fitted values) are present the
 estimated coefficients will not be available due to infinite
 estimates.  The deviances will normally continue to be correct, though.
