 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>If <code>x</code> is a matrix, it is taken as a two-dimensional contingency
 table, and hence its entries should be nonnegative integers.
 Otherwise, both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> must be vectors of the same
 length.  Incomplete cases are removed, the vectors are coerced into
 factor objects, and the contingency table is computed from these.
 </p>
 <p>For <i>2 by 2</i> cases, p-values are obtained directly
 using the (central or non-central) hypergeometric
 distribution. Otherwise, computations are based on a C version of the
 FORTRAN subroutine FEXACT which implements the network developed by
 Mehta and Patel (1986) and improved by Clarkson, Fan and Joe (1993).
 The FORTRAN code can be obtained from
 <a href="http://www.netlib.org/toms/643">http://www.netlib.org/toms/643</a>.  Note this fails (with an error
 message) when the entries of the table are too large.  (It transposes
 the table if necessary so it has no more rows than columns.  One
 constraint is that the product of the row marginals be less than
 <i>2^31 - 1</i>.)
 </p>
 <p>For <i>2 by 2</i> tables, the null of conditional
 independence is equivalent to the hypothesis that the odds ratio
 equals one.  &lsquo;Exact&rsquo; inference can be based on observing that in
 general, given all marginal totals fixed, the first element of the
 contingency table has a non-central hypergeometric distribution with
 non-centrality parameter given by the odds ratio (Fisher, 1935).  The
 alternative for a one-sided test is based on the odds ratio, so
 <code>alternative = "greater"</code> is a test of the odds ratio being bigger
 than <code>or</code>.
 </p>
 <p>Two-sided tests are based on the probabilities of the tables, and take
 as &lsquo;more extreme&rsquo; all tables with probabilities less than or
 equal to that of the observed table, the p-value being the sum of such
 probabilities.
 </p>
 <p>For larger than  <i>2 by 2</i> tables and <code>hybrid =
     TRUE</code>, asymptotic chi-squared probabilities are only used if the
 &lsquo;Cochran conditions&rsquo; are satisfied, that is if no cell has
 count zero, and more than 80% of the cells have counts at least 5:
 otherwise the exact calculation is used.
 </p>
 <p>Simulation is done conditional on the row and column marginals, and
 works only if the marginals are strictly positive.  (A C translation
 of the algorithm of Patefield (1981) is used.)
