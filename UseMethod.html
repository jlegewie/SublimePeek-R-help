 <h2>Class Methods</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p><font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> possesses a simple generic function mechanism which can be used for
 an object-oriented style of programming.  Method dispatch takes place
 based on the class(es) of the first argument to the generic function or of
 the object supplied as an argument to <code>UseMethod</code> or <code>NextMethod</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 UseMethod(generic, object)
 
 NextMethod(generic = NULL, object = NULL, ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>generic</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a character string naming a function (and not a
 built-in operator).  Required for <code>UseMethod</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>for <code>UseMethod</code>: an object whose class will
 determine the method to be dispatched.  Defaults to the first

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>An <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> object is a data object which has a <code>class</code>
 attribute (and this can be tested by <code>is.object</code>).
 A class attribute is a character vector giving the names of
 the classes from which the object <EM>inherits</EM>.
 If the object does not have a class attribute, it has an implicit
 class.  Matrices and arrays have class <code>"matrix"</code>
 or<code>"array"</code> followed by the class of the underlying vector.
 Most vectors have class the result of <code>mode(x)</code>, except
 that integer vectors have class <code>c("integer", "numeric")</code> and
 real vectors have class <code>c("double", "numeric")</code>.
 </p>
 <p>When a function calling <code>UseMethod("fun")</code> is applied to an
 object with class attribute <code>c("first", "second")</code>, the system
 searches for a function called <code>fun.first</code> and, if it finds it,
 applies it to the object.  If no such function is found a function
 called <code>fun.second</code> is tried.  If no class name produces a
 suitable function, the function <code>fun.default</code> is used, if it
 exists, or an error results.
 </p>
 <p>Function <code>methods</code> can be used to find out about the
 methods for a particular generic function or class.
 </p>
 <p><code>UseMethod</code> is a primitive function but (as from <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.11.0) uses
 standard argument matching.  It is not the only means of dispatch of
 methods, for there are internal generic and group generic
 functions.  <code>UseMethod</code> currently dispatches on the implicit
 class even for arguments that are not objects, but the other means of
 dispatch do not.
 </p>
 <p><code>NextMethod</code> invokes the next method (determined by the
 class vector, either of the object supplied to the generic, or of
 the first argument to the function containing <code>NextMethod</code> if a
 method was invoked directly).  Normally <code>NextMethod</code> is used with
 only one argument, <code>generic</code>, but if further arguments are
 supplied these modify the call to the next method.
 </p>
 <p><code>NextMethod</code> should not be called except in methods called by
 <code>UseMethod</code> or from internal generics (see
 InternalGenerics).  In particular it will not work inside
 anonymous calling functions (e.g. <code>get("print.ts")(AirPassengers)</code>).
 </p>
 <p>Namespaces can register methods for generic functions.  To support
 this, <code>UseMethod</code> and <code>NextMethod</code> search for methods in
 two places: first in the environment in which the generic function
 is called, and then in the registration data base for the
 environment in which the generic is defined (typically a namespace).
 So methods for a generic function need to be available in the
 environment of the call to the generic, or they must be registered.
 (It does not matter whether they are visible in the environment in
 which the generic is defined.)
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Technical Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>Now for some obscure details that need to appear somewhere.  These
 comments will be slightly different than those in Chambers(1992).
 (See also the draft &lsquo;R Language Definition&rsquo;.)
 <code>UseMethod</code> creates a new function call with
 arguments matched as they came in to the generic.  Any local variables
 defined before the call to <code>UseMethod</code> are retained (unlike S).  Any
 statements after the call to <code>UseMethod</code> will not be evaluated as
 <code>UseMethod</code> does not return.  <code>UseMethod</code> can be called with
 more than two arguments: a warning will be given and additional
 arguments ignored.  (They are not completely ignored in S.)  If it is
 called with just one argument, the class of the first argument of the
 enclosing function is used as <code>object</code>: unlike S this is the first
 actual argument passed and not the current value of the object of that
 name.
 </p>
 <p><code>NextMethod</code> works by creating a special call frame for the next
 method.  If no new arguments are supplied, the arguments will be the
 same in number, order and name as those to the current method but
 their values will be promises to evaluate their name in the current
 method and environment.  Any named arguments matched to <code>...</code>
 are handled specially: they either replace existing arguments of the
 same name or are appended to the argument list.  They are passed on as
 the promise that was supplied as an argument to the current
 environment.  (S does this differently!)  If they have been evaluated
 in the current (or a previous environment) they remain evaluated.
 (This is a complex area, and subject to change: see the draft
 &lsquo;R Language Definition&rsquo;.)
 </p>
 <p>The search for methods for <code>NextMethod</code> is slightly different
 from that for <code>UseMethod</code>.   Finding no <code>fun.default</code> is not
 necessarily an error, as the search continues to the generic
 itself.  This is to pick up an internal generic like <code>[</code>
 which has no separate default method, and succeeds only if the generic
 is a primitive function or a wrapper for a
 <code>.Internal</code> function of the same name.  (When a primitive
 is called as the default method, argument matching may not work as
 described above due to the different semantics of primitives.)
 </p>
 <p>You will see objects such as <code>.Generic</code>, <code>.Method</code>, and
 <code>.Class</code> used in methods.  These are set in the environment
 within which the method is evaluated by the dispatch mechanism, which
 is as follows:
 </p>
 
 <ol>
 <li><p> Find the context for the calling function (the generic): this
 gives us the unevaluated arguments for the original call.
 </p>
 </li>
 <li><p> Evaluate the object (usually an argument) to be used for
 dispatch, and find a method (possibly the default method) or throw
 an error.
 </p>
 </li>
 <li><p> Create an environment for evaluating the method and insert
 special variables (see below) into that environment.  Also copy any
 variables in the environment of the generic that are not formal (or
 actual) arguments.
 </p>
 </li>
 <li><p> Fix up the argument list to be the arguments of the call
 matched to the formals of the method.
 </p>
 </li></ol>
 
 <p><code>.Generic</code> is a length-one character vector naming the generic function.
 </p>
 <p><code>.Method</code> is a character vector (normally of length one) naming
 the method function.  (For functions in the group generic
 <code>Ops</code> it is of length two.)
 </p>
 <p><code>.Class</code> is a character vector of classes used to find the next
 method.  <code>NextMethod</code> adds an attribute <code>"previous"</code> to
 <code>.Class</code> giving the <code>.Class</code> last used for dispatch, and
 shifts <code>.Class</code> along to that used for dispatch.
 </p>
 <p><code>.GenericCallEnv</code> and <code>.GenericDefEnv</code> are the environments
 of the call to be generic and defining the generic respectively.  (The
 latter is used to find methods registered for the generic.)
 </p>
 <p>Note that <code>.Class</code> is set when the generic is called, and is
 unchanged if the class of the dispatching argument is changed in a
 method.  It is possible to change the method that <code>NextMethod</code>
 would dispatch by manipulating <code>.Class</code>, but &lsquo;this is not
 recommended unless you understand the inheritance mechanism
 thoroughly&rsquo; (Chambers &amp; Hastie, 1992, p. 469).

 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p>This scheme is called <EM>S3</EM> (S version 3).  For new projects,
 it is recommended to use the more flexible and robust <EM>S4</EM> scheme
 provided in the <span class="pkg">methods</span> package.
