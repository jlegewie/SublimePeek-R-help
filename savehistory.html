 <h2>Load or Save or Display the Commands History</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Load or save or display the commands history.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 loadhistory(file = ".Rhistory")
 savehistory(file = ".Rhistory")
 
 history(max.show = 25, reverse = FALSE, pattern, ...)
 
 timestamp(stamp = date(),
           prefix = "##------ ", suffix = " ------##",
           quiet = FALSE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>The name of the file in which to save the history, or
 from which to load it. The path is relative to the current
 working directory.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>max.show</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>The maximum number of lines to show. <code>Inf</code> will
 give all of the currently available history.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>reverse</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical. If true, the lines are shown in reverse
 order. Note: this is not useful when there are continuation lines.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>pattern</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A character string to be matched against the lines of
 the history</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Arguments to be passed to <code>grep</code> when doing
 the matching.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>stamp</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A value or vector of values to be written into the history.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>prefix</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A prefix to apply to each line.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>suffix</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A suffix to apply to each line.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>quiet</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>If <code>TRUE</code>, suppress printing timestamp to the console.</p>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>There are several history mechanisms available for the different <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 consoles, which work in similar but not identical ways.  Other uses of
 <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>, in particular embedded uses, may have no history.
 The functions described here work under the <code>readline</code>
 command-line interface but may not otherwise (for example, in batch
 use or in an embedded application).
 </p>
 <p>The <code>readline</code> history mechanism is controlled by two environment
 variables: <span class="env">R_HISTSIZE</span> controls the number of lines that are
 saved (default 512), and <span class="env">R_HISTFILE</span> sets the filename used for
 the loading/saving of history if requested at the beginning/end of a
 session (but not the default for these functions).  There is no limit
 on the number of lines of history retained during a session, so
 setting <span class="env">R_HISTSIZE</span> to a large value has no penalty unless a
 large file is actually generated.
 </p>
 <p>These variables are read at the time of saving, so can be altered
 within a session by the use of <code>Sys.setenv</code>.
 </p>
 <p>Note that <code>readline</code> history library saves files with permission
 <code>0600</code>, that is with read/write permission for the user and not
 even read permission for any other account.
 </p>
 <p><code>history</code> shows only unique matching lines if <code>pattern</code> is
 supplied.
 </p>
 <p>The <code>timestamp</code> function writes a timestamp (or other message)
 into the history and echos it to the console.  On platforms that do not
 support a history mechanism (where the mechanism does not support
 timestamps) only the console message is printed.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p>If you want to save the history at the end of (almost) every
 interactive session (even those in which you do not save the
 workspace), you can put a call to <code>savehistory()</code> in
 <code>.Last</code>.  See the examples.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>## Not run: 
 ## save the history in the home directory: note that it is not
 ## (by default) read from there.
 .Last &lt;- function()
     if(interactive()) try(savehistory("~/.Rhistory"))
 
 ## End(Not run)</pre>
