 <h2>Create a Class Definition</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Create  a class definition, specifying the representation (the
 slots) and/or the classes contained in this one (the superclasses),
 plus other optional details.  As a side effect, the class definition
 is stored in the specified environment.  A generator function
 is returned as the value of <code>setClass()</code>, suitable for creating
 objects from the class if the class is not virtual.  Of the many
 arguments to the function only <code>Class</code>,
 <code>representation</code> and <code>contains</code> are usually needed.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 setClass(Class, representation, prototype, contains=character(),
          validity, access, where, version, sealed, package,
          S3methods = FALSE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>Class</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character string name for the class.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>representation</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> a named list of the slots that the new class should have, the names giving the names of the slots and the corresponding elements being the character string names of  the corresponding classes.
 Usually a call to
 the <code>representation</code> function.
 </p>
 <p>Backward compatibility and compatibility with S-Plus allows unnamed
 elements for superclasses, but the recommended style is to use the
 <code>contains=</code> argument instead.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>prototype</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> an object providing the default
 data for the slots in this class.  By default, each will be the
 prototype object for the superclass.  If provided, using a call to
 <code>prototype</code> will carry out some checks. </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>contains</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> the names (and optionally package slots) for the <EM>superclasses</EM> of this class.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>where</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> the
 environment in which to store the
 definition.  Should not be supplied in standard use.  For calls to <code>setClass()</code> appearing in the
 source code for a package, will default to the namespace of
 the package.  For calls typed or sourced at the top level in a
 session, will default to the global environment.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>validity</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> if supplied, should be a validity-checking method
 for objects from this class (a function that returns <code>TRUE</code> if
 its argument is a valid object of this class and one or more strings
 describing the failures otherwise).  See <code>validObject</code>
 for details.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>access, version</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>access and version, included for
 historical compatibility with S-Plus, but ignored.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>sealed</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> if <code>TRUE</code>, the class definition will be sealed,
 so that another call to <code>setClass</code> will fail on this class name.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>package</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> an optional package name for the class.  Should very
 rarely be used. By default
 the name of the package in which the class definition is assigned.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>S3methods</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>if <code>TRUE</code>, S3 methods may be written for this
 class.  S3 generic functions and primitives will
 dispatch an S3 method defined for this class, given an S4 object
 from the class or from a subclass of it, provided no S4
 method and no more
 direct S3 method is found.  This argument should rarely be used:
 It is not needed for
 classes that are defined via <code>setOldClass</code> or for
 classes that extend such classes, which will nearly always be
 the case when S3 methods are relevant.
 </p>
 </td></tr>

 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A generator function suitable for creating objects from the class is
 returned, invisibly.  A call to this function generates a call to
 <code>new</code> for the class.  The call takes any number of arguments,
 which will be passed on to the initialize method.  If no
 <code>initialize</code> method is defined for the class or one of its
 superclasses, the default method expects named arguments with the
 name of one of the slots.
 </p>
 <p>Typically the generator function is assigned the name of the class,
 for programming clarity.  This is not a requirement and objects
 from the class can also be generated directly from
 <code>new</code>.  The advantages of the generator function are a
 slightly simpler and clearer call, and that the call will contain
 the package name of the class (eliminating any ambiguity if two
 classes from different packages have the same name).
 </p>
 <p>If the class is virtual, an attempt to generate an object  from
 either the generator or <code>new()</code>
 will result in an error.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Basic Use: Slots and Inheritance</h3>
 
 
 <p>The two essential arguments other than the class name are
 <code>representation</code> and <code>contains</code>, defining the explicit slots
 and the inheritance (superclasses). Together, these arguments define
 all the information in an object from this class; that is, the names
 of all the slots and the classes required for each of them.
 </p>
 <p>The name of the class determines
 which methods apply directly to objects from this class.  The
 inheritance information specifies which methods apply indirectly,
 through inheritance.  See Methods.
 </p>
 <p>The slots in a class definition will be the union of all the slots
 specified directly by <code>representation</code> and all the slots in all
 the contained classes.
 There can only be one slot with a given name; specifically, the
 direct and inherited slot names must be unique.
 That does not, however, prevent the same class from being inherited
 via more than one path.
 </p>
 <p>One kind of element in the <code>contains=</code> argument is special, specifying one of the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 object types or one of a few other special <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> types (<code>matrix</code> and
 <code>array</code>).
 See the section on inheriting from object types, below.
 </p>
 <p>Slot name <code>"class"</code> is not allowed in the current implementation but
 reserved. <code>"Class"</code> is valid, but undesirable, as it cannot be
 used in <code>new(&lt;cl&gt;, Class = &lt;slot-value&gt;)</code> (because of
 argument name matching).
 There are other slot names with a special meaning; these names start with
 the <code>"."</code> character.  To be safe, you should define all of
 your own slots with names starting with an alphabetic character.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Inheriting from Object Types</h3>
 
 
 <p>In addition to containing other S4 classes, a class definition can
 contain either an S3 class (see the next section) or a built-in R pseudo-class&mdash;one
 of the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 object types or one of the special <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> pseudo-classes <code>"matrix"</code> and
 <code>"array"</code>.
 A class can contain at most one of the object types, directly or indirectly.
 When it does, that contained class determines the &ldquo;data part&rdquo;
 of the class.
 </p>
 <p>Objects from the new class try to inherit the built in
 behavior of the contained type.
 In the case of normal <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> data types, including vectors, functions and
 expressions, the implementation is relatively straightforward.
 For any object <code>x</code> from the class,
 <code>typeof(x)</code> will be the contained basic type; and a special
 pseudo-slot, <code>.Data</code>, will be shown with the corresponding class.
 See the <code>"numWithId"</code> example below.
 </p>
 <p>Classes may also inherit from <code>"vector"</code>, <code>"matrix"</code> or
 <code>"array"</code>.
 The data part of these objects can be any vector data type.
 </p>
 <p>For an object from any class that does <EM>not</EM> contain one of these
 types or classes,
 <code>typeof(x)</code> will be <code>"S4"</code>.
 </p>
 <p>Some <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> data types do not behave normally, in the sense that they are
 non-local references or other objects that are not duplicated.
 Examples include those corresponding to classes <code>"environment"</code>, <code>"externalptr"</code>, and <code>"name"</code>.
 These can not be the types for objects with user-defined
 classes (either S4 or S3) because setting an attribute overwrites the
 object in all contexts.
 It is possible to define a class that inherits from such types,
 through an indirect mechanism that stores the inherited object in a
 reserved slot.
 See the
 example for class <code>"stampedEnv"</code> below.
 S3 method dispatch and the relevant <code>as.</code><EM>type</EM><code>()</code>
 functions should behave correctly, but code that uses the type of the
 object directly will not.
 </p>
 <p>Also, keep in mind that the object passed to low-level computations
 will be the underlying object type, <EM>without</EM> any of the slots
 defined in the class.
 To return the full information, you will usually have to define a
 method that sets the data part.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Inheriting from S3 Classes</h3>
 
 
 <p>Old-style S3 classes have no formal definition.  Objects are
 &ldquo;from&rdquo; the class when their class attribute contains the
 character string considered to be the class name.
 </p>
 <p>Using such classes with formal classes and methods is necessarily a
 risky business, since there are no guarantees about the content of the
 objects or about consistency of inherited methods.
 Given that, it is still possible to define a class that inherits from
 an S3 class, providing that class has been registered as an old class
 (see <code>setOldClass</code>).
 </p>
 <p>Broadly speaking, both S3 and S4 method dispatch try to behave
 sensibly with respect to inheritance in either system.
 Given an S4 object, S3 method dispatch and the <code>inherits</code>
 function should use the S4 inheritance information.
 Given an S3 object, an S4 generic function will dispatch S4 methods
 using the S3 inheritance, provided that inheritance has been declared via
 <code>setOldClass</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Classes and Packages</h3>
 
 
 <p>Class definitions normally belong to packages (but can be defined in
 the  global environment as well, by evaluating the expression on the
 command line or in a file sourced from the command line).
 The corresponding package name is part of the class definition; that
 is, part of the <code>classRepresentation</code> object holding that
 definition.  Thus, two classes with the same name can exist in
 different packages, for most purposes.
 </p>
 <p>When a class name is supplied for a slot or a superclass in a call to
 <code>setClass</code>, a
 corresponding class definition will be found, looking from the
 namespace of the current package, assuming the call in question appears directly in the source for the
 package, as it should to avoid ambiguity.
 The  class definition
 must be found in the namespace of the current package, in the imports for that
 namespace or in the basic classes defined by the methods package.
 (The methods package must be included in the <code>Depends</code> directive
 of the package's <code>"DESCRIPTION"</code> file in order for the
 <code>"CMD check"</code> utility to find these classes.)
 </p>
 <p>When this rule does not identify a class uniquely (because it appears
 in more than one imported package) then the <code>packageSlot</code>
 of the character string name needs to be supplied with the name.
 This should be a rare occurrence.
