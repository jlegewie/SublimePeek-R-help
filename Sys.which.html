 <h2>Find Full Paths to Executables</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>This is an interface to the system command <code>which</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 Sys.which(names)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>names</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Character vector of names of possible executables.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The system command <code>which</code> reports on the full names of an
 executable (including an executable script) found on the current path.
 </p>
 <p>On Windows an &lsquo;executable&rsquo; is a file with extension
 &lsquo;<span class="file">.exe</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="file">.com</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="file">.cmd</span>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<span class="file">.bat</span>&rsquo;.  Such files need
 not actually be executable, but they are what <code>system</code>
 tries.
 </p>
 <p>On a Unix-alike the full path to <code>which</code> (usually
 &lsquo;<span class="file">/usr/bin/which</span>&rsquo;) is found when <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> is installed and (currently)
 stored in environment variable <code>WHICH</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A character vector of the same length as <code>names</code>, named by
 <code>names</code>.  The elements are either the full path to the
 executable  or some indication that no executable of that name was
 found.  Typically the indication is <code>""</code>, but this does depend on
 the OS (and the known exceptions are changed to <code>""</code>).
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>
 ## the first two are likely to exist everywhere
 ## texi2dvi exists on most Unix-alikes and under MiKTeX
 Sys.which(c("ftp", "ping", "texi2dvi", "this-does-not-exist"))
 </pre>
