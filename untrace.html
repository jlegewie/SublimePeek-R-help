 <h2>Interactive Tracing and Debugging of Calls to a Function or Method</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>A call to <code>trace</code> allows you to insert debugging code (e.g., a
 call to <code>browser</code> or <code>recover</code>) at chosen
 places in any function.  A call to <code>untrace</code> cancels the tracing.
 Specified methods can be traced the same way, without tracing all
 calls to the function.  Trace code can be any <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> expression.  Tracing
 can be temporarily turned on or off globally by calling <code>tracingState</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 trace(what, tracer, exit, at, print, signature,
       where = topenv(parent.frame()), edit = FALSE)
 untrace(what, signature = NULL, where = topenv(parent.frame()))
 
 tracingState(on = NULL)
 .doTrace(expr, msg)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>what</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>The name (quoted or not) of a function to be traced or
 untraced.  For <code>untrace</code> or for <code>trace</code> with more than one
 argument, more than one name can be given in the quoted form, and
 the same action will be applied to each one.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>tracer</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Either a function or an unevaluated expression.  The
 function will be called or the expression will be evaluated either
 at the beginning of the call, or before those steps in the call
 specified by the argument <code>at</code>.
 See the details section.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>exit</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> Either a function or an unevaluated expression.  The
 function will be called or the expression will be evaluated on
 exiting the function.
 See the details section.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>at</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>optional numeric vector or list.  If supplied, <code>tracer</code>
 will be called just before the corresponding step in the body of the
 function.
 See the details section. </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>print</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>If <code>TRUE</code> (as per default), a descriptive line is
 printed before any trace expression is evaluated.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>signature</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> If this argument is supplied, it should be a
 signature for a method for function <code>what</code>.  In this case, the
 method, and <EM>not</EM> the function itself, is traced.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>edit</code></td>
 <td>
 <p> For complicated tracing, such as tracing within a loop
 inside the function, you will need to insert the desired calls by
 editing the body of the function.  If so, supply the <code>edit</code>
 argument either as <code>TRUE</code>, or as the name of the editor you
 want to use.  Then <code>trace()</code> will call <code>edit</code> and
 use the version of the function after you edit it.  See the details
 section for additional information.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>where</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>where to look for the function to be
 traced; by default, the top-level environment of the call to
 <code>trace</code>.
 </p>
 <p>An important use of this argument is to trace a function when it
 is called from a package with a namespace.  The current namespace mechanism
 imports the functions to be called (with the exception of functions
 in the base package).  The functions being called are <EM>not</EM> the
 same objects seen from the top-level (in general, the imported
 packages may not even be attached).  Therefore, you must ensure that
 the correct versions are being traced.  The way to do this is to set
 argument <code>where</code> to a function in the namespace.  The tracing
 computations will then start looking in the environment of that
 function (which will be the namespace of the corresponding package).
 (Yes, it's subtle, but the semantics here are central to how
 namespaces work in R.)
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>on</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical; a call to  the support function <code>tracingState</code> returns <code>TRUE</code>
 if tracing is globally turned on, <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.  An
 argument of one or the other of those values sets the state.  If the
 tracing state is <code>FALSE</code>, none of the trace actions will
 actually occur (used, for example, by debugging functions to shut
 off tracing during debugging).</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>expr, msg</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>arguments to the support function <code>.doTrace</code>, calls to
 which are inserted into the modified function or method:
 <code>expr</code> is the tracing action (such as a call to
 <code>browser()</code>, and <code>msg</code> is a string identifying the
 place where the trace action occurs.

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The <code>trace</code> function operates by constructing a revised version
 of the function (or of the method, if <code>signature</code> is supplied),
 and assigning the new object back where the original was found.
 If only the <code>what</code> argument is given, a line of trace printing is
 produced for each call to the function (back compatible with the
 earlier version of <code>trace</code>).
 </p>
 <p>The object constructed by <code>trace</code> is from a class that extends
 <code>"function"</code> and which contains the original, untraced version.
 A call to <code>untrace</code> re-assigns this version.
 </p>
 <p>If the argument <code>tracer</code> or <code>exit</code> is the name of a
 function, the tracing expression will be a call to that function, with
 no arguments.  This is the easiest and most common case, with the
 functions <code>browser</code> and <code>recover</code> the
 likeliest candidates; the former browses in the frame of the function
 being traced, and the latter allows browsing in any of the currently
 active calls.
 </p>
 <p>The <code>tracer</code> or <code>exit</code> argument can also be an unevaluated
 expression (such as returned by a call to <code>quote</code> or
 <code>substitute</code>).  This expression itself is inserted in the
 traced function, so it will typically involve arguments or local
 objects in the traced function.  An expression of this form is useful
 if you only want to interact when certain conditions apply (and in
 this case you probably want to supply <code>print=FALSE</code> in the call
 to <code>trace</code> also).
 </p>
 <p>When the <code>at</code> argument is supplied, it can be a vector of
 integers referring to the substeps of the body of the function (this
 only works if the body of the function is enclosed in <code>{ ...}</code>.  In
 this case <code>tracer</code> is <EM>not</EM> called on entry, but instead
 just before evaluating each of the steps listed in <code>at</code>.  (Hint:
 you don't want to try to count the steps in the printed version of a
 function; instead, look at <code>as.list(body(f))</code> to get the numbers
 associated with the steps in function <code>f</code>.)
 </p>
 <p>The <code>at</code> argument can also be a list of integer vectors.  In
 this case, each vector refers to a step nested within another step of
 the function.  For example, <code>at = list(c(3,4))</code>
 will call the tracer just before the fourth step of the third step
 of the function.  See the example below.
 </p>
 <p>Using <code>setBreakpoint</code> (from package <span class="pkg">utils</span>) may be an
 alternative, calling <code>trace(...., at, ...)</code>.
 </p>
 <p>An intrinsic limitation in the <code>exit</code> argument is that it won't
 work if the function itself uses <code>on.exit</code>, since the existing
 calls will override the one supplied by <code>trace</code>.
 </p>
 <p>Tracing does not nest.  Any call to <code>trace</code> replaces previously
 traced versions of that function or method (except for edited
 versions as discussed below), and <code>untrace</code> always
 restores an untraced version.  (Allowing nested tracing has too many
 potentials for confusion and for accidentally leaving traced versions
 behind.)
 </p>
 <p>When the <code>edit</code> argument is used repeatedly with no call to
 <code>untrace</code> on the same function or method in between, the
 previously edited version is retained.  If you want to throw away
 all the previous tracing and then edit, call <code>untrace</code> before the next
 call to <code>trace</code>.  Editing may be combined with automatic
 tracing; just supply the other arguments such as <code>tracer</code>, and
 the <code>edit</code> argument as well.  The <code>edit=TRUE</code> argument
 uses the default editor (see <code>edit</code>).
 </p>
 <p>Tracing primitive functions (builtins and specials) from the base
 package works, but only by a special mechanism and not very
 informatively.  Tracing a primitive causes the primitive to be
 replaced by a function with argument ... (only).  You can get a bit
 of information out, but not much.  A warning message is issued when
 <code>trace</code> is used on a primitive.
 </p>
 <p>The practice of saving the traced version of the function back where
 the function came from means that tracing carries over from one
 session to another, <EM>if</EM> the traced function is saved in the
 session image.  (In the next session, <code>untrace</code> will remove the
 tracing.)  On the other hand, functions that were in a package, not in
 the global environment, are not saved in the image, so tracing expires
 with the session for such functions.
 </p>
 <p>Tracing a method is basically just like tracing a function, with the
 exception that the traced version is stored by a call to
 <code>setMethod</code> rather than by direct assignment, and so is
 the untraced version after a call to <code>untrace</code>.
 </p>
 <p>The version of <code>trace</code> described here is largely compatible with
 the version in S-Plus, although the two work by entirely different
 mechanisms.  The S-Plus <code>trace</code> uses the session frame, with the
 result that tracing never carries over from one session to another (<font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
 does not have a session frame).  Another relevant distinction has
 nothing directly to do with <code>trace</code>:  The browser in S-Plus
 allows changes to be made to the frame being browsed, and the changes
 will persist after exiting the browser.  The <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> browser allows changes,
 but they disappear when the browser exits.  This may be relevant in
 that the S-Plus version allows you to experiment with code changes
 interactively, but the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> version does not.  (A future revision may
 include a &lsquo;destructive&rsquo; browser for <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.)
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>In the simple version (just the first argument), invisible <code>NULL</code>.
 Otherwise, the traced function(s) name(s).  The relevant consequence is the
 assignment that takes place.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p>The version of function tracing that includes any of the arguments
 except for the function name requires the <span class="pkg">methods</span> package
 (because it uses special classes of objects to store and restore
 versions of the traced functions).
 </p>
 <p>If methods dispatch is not currently on, <code>trace</code> will load the
 methods namespace, but will not put the methods package on the search
 list.

 <pre>
 require(graphics)
 
 ##  Very simple use
 trace(sum)
 hist(stats::rnorm(100)) # shows about 3-4 calls to sum()
 untrace(sum)
 
 if(.isMethodsDispatchOn()) { # non-simple use needs 'methods' package
 
 f &lt;- function(x, y) {
     y &lt;- pmax(y, 0.001)
     if (x &gt; 0) x ^ y else stop("x must be positive")
 }
 
 ## arrange to call the browser on entering and exiting
 ## function f
 trace("f", quote(browser(skipCalls=4)),
       exit = quote(browser(skipCalls=4)))
 
 ## instead, conditionally assign some data, and then browse
 ## on exit, but only then.  Don't bother me otherwise
 
 trace("f", quote(if(any(y &lt; 0)) yOrig &lt;- y),
       exit = quote(if(exists("yOrig")) browser(skipCalls=4)),
       print = FALSE)
 
 ## Enter the browser just before stop() is called.  First, find
 ## the step numbers
 
 as.list(body(f))
 as.list(body(f)[[3]])
 
 ## Now call the browser there
 
 trace("f", quote(browser(skipCalls=4)), at=list(c(3,4)))
 
 ## trace a utility function, with recover so we
 ## can browse in the calling functions as well.
 
 trace("as.matrix", recover)
 
 ## turn off the tracing
 
 untrace(c("f", "as.matrix"))
 
 ## Not run: 
 ## trace calls to the function lm() that come from
 ## the nlme package.
 ## (The function nlme is in that package, and the package
 ## has a namespace, so the where= argument must be used
 ## to get the right version of lm)
 
 trace(lm, exit = recover, where = nlme)
