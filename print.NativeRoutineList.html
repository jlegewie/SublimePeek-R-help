 <h2>Reflectance Information for C/Fortran routines in a DLL</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>This function allows us to query the set of routines
 in a DLL that are registered with R to enhance
 dynamic lookup, error handling when calling native routines,
 and potentially security in the future.
 This function provides a description of each of the
 registered routines in the DLL for the different interfaces,
 i.e. <code>.C</code>, <code>.Call</code>, <code>.Fortran</code>
 and <code>.External</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 getDLLRegisteredRoutines(dll, addNames = TRUE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>dll</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a character string or <code>DLLInfo</code> object.
 The character string specifies the file name of the DLL
 of interest, and is given without the file name extension (e.g., the
 &lsquo;<span class="file">.dll</span>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<span class="file">.so</span>&rsquo;) and with no directory/path information.
 So a file &lsquo;<span class="file">MyPackage/libs/MyPackage.so</span>&rsquo; would be specified as
 <span class="samp">MyPackage</span>.
 </p>
 <p>The <code>DLLInfo</code> objects can be obtained directly
 in calls to <code>dyn.load</code> and  <code>library.dynam</code>,
 or can be found after the DLL has been loaded using
 <code>getLoadedDLLs</code>, which returns a list of
 <code>DLLInfo</code> objects (index-able by DLL file name).
 </p>
 <p>The <code>DLLInfo</code> approach avoids any ambiguities related to two
 DLLs having the same name but corresponding to files in different
 directories.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>addNames</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a logical value.  If this is <code>TRUE</code>, the elements
 of the returned lists are named using the names of the routines (as
 seen by R via registration or raw name).  If <code>FALSE</code>,
 these names are not computed and assigned to the lists.  As a
 result, the call should be quicker.  The name information is also
 available in the <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> objects in the lists.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>This takes the registration information after it has been registered
 and processed by the R internals.  In other words, it uses the extended
 information
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A list with four elements corresponding to the routines
 registered for the .C, .Call, .Fortran and .External interfaces.
 Each element is a list with as many elements as there were
 routines registered for that interface.
 Each element identifies a routine and is an object
 of class <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code>.
 An object of this class has the following fields:
 </p>
 <table summary="R valueblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>name</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the registered name of the routine (not necessarily the
 name in the C code).</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>address</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the memory address of the routine as resolved in the
 loaded DLL. This may be <code>NULL</code> if the symbol has not yet been
 resolved.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>dll</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>an object of class <code>DLLInfo</code> describing the DLL.
 This is same for all elements returned.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>numParameters</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the number of arguments the native routine is to
 be called with.  In the future, we will provide information about
 the types of the parameters also.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
