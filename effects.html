 <h2>Effects from Fitted Model</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Returns (orthogonal) effects from a fitted model, usually a linear
 model. This is a generic function, but currently only has a methods for
 objects inheriting from classes <code>"lm"</code> and <code>"glm"</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 effects(object, ...)
 
 ## S3 method for class 'lm'
 effects(object, set.sign = FALSE, ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>an <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> object; typically, the result of a model fitting function
 such as <code>lm</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>set.sign</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical. If <code>TRUE</code>, the sign of the effects
 corresponding to coefficients in the model will be set to agree with the
 signs of the corresponding coefficients, otherwise the sign is
 arbitrary.</p>

 <p>arguments passed to or from other methods.</p>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>For a linear model fitted by <code>lm</code> or <code>aov</code>,
 the effects are the uncorrelated single-degree-of-freedom values
 obtained by projecting the data onto the successive orthogonal
 subspaces generated by the QR decomposition during the fitting
 process. The first <i>r</i> (the rank of the model) are associated with
 coefficients and the remainder span the space of residuals (but are
 not associated with particular residuals).
 </p>
 <p>Empty models do not have effects.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A (named) numeric vector of the same length as
 <code>residuals</code>, or a matrix if there were multiple responses
 in the fitted model, in either case of class <code>"coef"</code>.
 </p>
 <p>The first <i>r</i> rows are labelled by the corresponding coefficients,
 and the remaining rows are unlabelled.  Note that in rank-deficient
 models the corresponding coefficients will be in a different
 order if pivoting occurred.
