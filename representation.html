 <h2> Construct a Representation or a Prototype for a Class Definition</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>In calls to
 <code>setClass</code>, these two functions construct,
 respectively, the <code>representation</code> and <code>prototype</code>
 arguments.  They do various checks and handle special cases.  You're
 encouraged to use them when defining classes that, for
 example, extend other classes as a data part or have multiple
 superclasses, or that combine extending a class and slots.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 representation(...)
 prototype(...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>The call to representation takes arguments that are single character
 strings.  Unnamed arguments are classes that a newly defined class
 extends; named arguments name the explicit slots in the new class,
 and specify what class each slot should have.
 </p>
 <p>In the call to <code>prototype</code>, if an unnamed argument is
 supplied, it unconditionally forms the basis for the prototype
 object.  Remaining arguments are taken to correspond to slots of
 this object.  It is an error to supply more than one unnamed argument.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The <code>representation</code> function applies tests for the validity of
 the arguments.  Each must specify the name of a class.
 </p>
 <p>The classes named don't have to exist when <code>representation</code> is
 called, but if they do, then the function will check for any duplicate
 slot names introduced by each of the inherited classes.
 </p>
 <p>The arguments to <code>prototype</code> are usually named initial values
 for slots, plus an optional first argument that gives the object
 itself.  The unnamed argument is typically useful if there is a data
 part to the definition (see the examples below).
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>The value of <code>representation</code>  is just the list of arguments, after these have been checked
 for validity.
 </p>
 <p>The value of <code>prototype</code> is the object to be used as the
 prototype.  Slots will have been set consistently with the
 arguments, but the construction does <EM>not</EM> use the class
 definition to test validity of the contents (it hardly can, since
 the prototype object is usually supplied to create the definition).
