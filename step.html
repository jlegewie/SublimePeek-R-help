 <h2>
 Choose a model by AIC in a Stepwise Algorithm
 </h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Select a formula-based model by AIC.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 step(object, scope, scale = 0,
      direction = c("both", "backward", "forward"), 
      trace = 1, keep = NULL, steps = 1000, k = 2, ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>object</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>an object representing a model of an appropriate class (mainly
 <code>"lm"</code> and <code>"glm"</code>).
 This is used as the initial model in the stepwise search.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>scope</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>defines the range of models examined in the stepwise search.
 This should be either a single formula, or a list containing
 components <code>upper</code> and <code>lower</code>, both formulae.  See the
 details for how to specify the formulae and how they are used.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>scale</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>used in the definition of the AIC statistic for selecting the models,
 currently only for <code>lm</code>, <code>aov</code> and
 <code>glm</code> models.  The default value, <code>0</code>, indicates
 the scale should be estimated: see <code>extractAIC</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>direction</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>the mode of stepwise search, can be one of <code>"both"</code>,
 <code>"backward"</code>, or <code>"forward"</code>, with a default of <code>"both"</code>. 
 If the <code>scope</code> argument is missing the default for
 <code>direction</code> is <code>"backward"</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>trace</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>if positive, information is printed during the running of <code>step</code>.
 Larger values may give more detailed information.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>keep</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>a filter function whose input is a fitted model object and the 
 associated <code>AIC</code> statistic, and whose output is arbitrary. 
 Typically <code>keep</code> will select a subset of the components of 
 the object and return them. The default is not to keep anything.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>steps</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>the maximum number of steps to be considered.  The default is 1000
 (essentially as many as required).  It is typically used to stop the
 process early.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>k</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>the multiple of the number of degrees of freedom used for the penalty.
 Only <code>k = 2</code> gives the genuine AIC: <code>k = log(n)</code> is sometimes
 referred to as BIC or SBC.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 
 <p>any additional arguments to <code>extractAIC</code>.
 </p>
 </td></tr>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>step</code> uses <code>add1</code> and <code>drop1</code>
 repeatedly; it will work for any method for which they work, and that
 is determined by having a valid method for <code>extractAIC</code>.
 When the additive constant can be chosen so that AIC is equal to
 Mallows' <i>Cp</i>, this is done and the tables are labelled
 appropriately.
 </p>
 <p>The set of models searched is determined by the <code>scope</code> argument.
 The right-hand-side of its <code>lower</code> component is always included
 in the model, and right-hand-side of the model is included in the
 <code>upper</code> component.  If <code>scope</code> is a single formula, it
 specifies the <code>upper</code> component, and the <code>lower</code> model is
 empty.  If <code>scope</code> is missing, the initial model is used as the
 <code>upper</code> model.
 </p>
 <p>Models specified by <code>scope</code> can be templates to update
 <code>object</code> as used by <code>update.formula</code>.  So using
 <code>.</code> in a <code>scope</code> formula means &lsquo;what is
 already there&rsquo;, with <code>.^2</code> indicating all interactions of
 existing terms.
 </p>
 <p>There is a potential problem in using <code>glm</code> fits with a
 variable <code>scale</code>, as in that case the deviance is not simply
 related to the maximized log-likelihood.  The <code>"glm"</code> method for
 function <code>extractAIC</code> makes the
 appropriate adjustment for a <code>gaussian</code> family, but may need to be
 amended for other cases.  (The <code>binomial</code> and <code>poisson</code>
 families have fixed <code>scale</code> by default and do not correspond
 to a particular maximum-likelihood problem for variable <code>scale</code>.)
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>the stepwise-selected model is returned, with up to two additional
 components.  There is an <code>"anova"</code> component corresponding to the
 steps taken in the search, as well as a <code>"keep"</code> component if the
 <code>keep=</code> argument was supplied in the call. The
 <code>"Resid. Dev"</code> column of the analysis of deviance table refers
 to a constant minus twice the maximized log likelihood: it will be a
 deviance only in cases where a saturated model is well-defined
 (thus excluding <code>lm</code>, <code>aov</code> and <code>survreg</code> fits,
 for example).
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Warning</h3>
 
 
 <p>The model fitting must apply the models to the same dataset. This
 may be a problem if there are missing values and <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>'s default of
 <code>na.action = na.omit</code> is used.  We suggest you remove the
 missing values first.
 </p>
 <p>Calls to the function <code>nobs</code> are used to check that the
 number of observations involved in the fitting process remains unchanged.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p>This function differs considerably from the function in S, which uses a
 number of approximations and does not in general compute the correct AIC.
 </p>
 <p>This is a minimal implementation.  Use <code>stepAIC</code>
 in package <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MASS"><span class="pkg">MASS</span></a> for a wider range of object classes.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Author(s)</h3>
 
 
 <p>B. D. Ripley: <code>step</code> is a slightly simplified version of
 <code>stepAIC</code> in package <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MASS"><span class="pkg">MASS</span></a> (Venables &amp;
 Ripley, 2002 and earlier editions).
 </p>
 <p>The idea of a <code>step</code> function follows that described in Hastie &amp;
 Pregibon (1992); but the implementation in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> is more general.
