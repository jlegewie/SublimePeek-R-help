 <h2>Test Objects for Exact Equality</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>The safe and reliable way to test two objects for being
 <EM>exactly</EM> equal.  It returns <code>TRUE</code> in this case,
 <code>FALSE</code> in every other case.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 identical(x, y, num.eq = TRUE, single.NA = TRUE, attrib.as.set = TRUE,
                 ignore.bytecode = TRUE)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x, y</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>any <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> objects.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>num.eq</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical indicating if (<code>double</code> and
 <code>complex</code> non-<code>NA</code>) numbers should be
 compared using <code>==</code> (&lsquo;equal&rsquo;), or by bitwise
 comparison.  The latter (non-default) differentiates between
 <code>-0</code> and <code>+0</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>single.NA</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical indicating if there is conceptually just one numeric
 <code>NA</code> and one <code>NaN</code>;  <code>single.NA = FALSE</code>
 differentiates bit patterns.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>attrib.as.set</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical indicating if <code>attributes</code> of
 <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> should be treated as <EM>unordered</EM> tagged
 pairlists (&ldquo;sets&rdquo;); this currently also applies to
 <code>slot</code>s of S4 objects.  It may well be too strict to set
 <code>attrib.as.set = FALSE</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>ignore.bytecode</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical indicating if byte code should be
 ignored when comparing functions.</p>
 </td></tr>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>A call to <code>identical</code> is the way to test exact equality in
 <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> statements, as well as in logical
 expressions that use <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code>.  In all these
 applications you need to be assured of getting a single logical
 value.
 </p>
 <p>Users often use the comparison operators, such as <code>==</code> or
 <code>!=</code>, in these situations.  It looks natural, but it is not what
 these operators are designed to do in R.  They return an object like
 the arguments.  If you expected <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to be of length
 1, but it happened that one of them wasn't, you will <EM>not</EM> get a
 single <code>FALSE</code>.  Similarly, if one of the arguments is <code>NA</code>,
 the result is also <code>NA</code>.  In either case, the expression
 <code>if(x == y)....</code> won't work as expected.
 </p>
 <p>The function <code>all.equal</code> is also sometimes used to test equality
 this way, but was intended for something different:  it allows for
 small differences in numeric results.
 </p>
 <p>The computations in <code>identical</code> are also reliable and usually
 fast.  There should never be an error.  The only known way to kill
 <code>identical</code> is by having an invalid pointer at the C level,
 generating a memory fault.  It will usually find inequality quickly.
 Checking equality for two large, complicated objects can take longer
 if the objects are identical or nearly so, but represent completely
 independent copies.  For most applications, however, the computational cost
 should be negligible.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>single.NA</code> is true, as by default, <code>identical</code> sees
 <code>NaN</code> as different from <code>NA_real_</code>, but all
 <code>NaN</code>s are equal (and all <code>NA</code> of the same type are equal).
 </p>
 <p>Character strings are regarded as identical if they are in different
 marked encodings but would agree when translated to UTF-8.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>attrib.as.set</code> is true, as by default, comparison of
 attributes view them as a set (and not a vector, so order is not
 tested).
 </p>
 <p>If <code>ignore.bytecode</code> is true (the default), the compiled
 bytecode of a function (see <code>cmpfun</code>) will be ignored in
 the comparison. If it is false, functions will compare equal only if
 they are copies of the same compiled object (or both are
 uncompiled).  To check whether two different compiles are equal, you
 should compare the results of <code>disassemble()</code>.
 </p>
 <p>Note that <code>identical(x,y,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE)</code> pickily tests for
 very exact equality.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A single logical value, <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>, never <code>NA</code>
 and never anything other than a single value.

 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>
 identical(1, NULL) ## FALSE -- don't try this with ==
 identical(1, 1.)   ## TRUE in R (both are stored as doubles)
 identical(1, as.integer(1)) ## FALSE, stored as different types
 
 x &lt;- 1.0; y &lt;- 0.99999999999
 ## how to test for object equality allowing for numeric fuzz :
 (E &lt;- all.equal(x,y))
 isTRUE(E) # which is simply defined to just use
 identical(TRUE, E)
 ## If all.equal thinks the objects are different, it returns a
 ## character string, and the above expression evaluates to FALSE
 
 ## even for unusual R objects :
 identical(.GlobalEnv, environment())
 
 ### ------- Pickyness Flags : -----------------------------
 
 ## the infamous example:
 identical(0., -0.) # TRUE, i.e. not differentiated
 identical(0., -0., num.eq = FALSE)
 ## similar:
 identical(NaN, -NaN) # TRUE
 identical(NaN, -NaN, single.NA=FALSE) # differ on bit-level
 ## for functions:
 f &lt;- function(x) x
 f
 g &lt;- compiler::cmpfun(f)
 g
 identical(f, g)
 identical(f, g, ignore.bytecode=FALSE)
