 <h2>ARIMA Modelling of Time Series</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Fit an ARIMA model to a univariate time series.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 arima(x, order = c(0, 0, 0),
       seasonal = list(order = c(0, 0, 0), period = NA),
       xreg = NULL, include.mean = TRUE,
       transform.pars = TRUE,
       fixed = NULL, init = NULL,
       method = c("CSS-ML", "ML", "CSS"),
       n.cond, optim.method = "BFGS",
       optim.control = list(), kappa = 1e6)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a univariate time series</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>order</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A specification of the non-seasonal part of the ARIMA
 model: the three components <i>(p, d, q)</i> are the AR order, the
 degree of differencing, and the MA order.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>seasonal</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A specification of the seasonal part of the ARIMA
 model, plus the period (which defaults to <code>frequency(x)</code>).
 This should be a list with components <code>order</code> and
 <code>period</code>, but a specification of just a numeric vector of
 length 3 will be turned into a suitable list with the specification
 as the <code>order</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>xreg</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Optionally, a vector or matrix of external regressors,
 which must have the same number of rows as <code>x</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>include.mean</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Should the ARMA model include a mean/intercept term?  The
 default is <code>TRUE</code> for undifferenced series, and it is ignored
 for ARIMA models with differencing.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>transform.pars</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Logical.  If true, the AR parameters are
 transformed to ensure that they remain in the region of
 stationarity.  Not used for <code>method = "CSS"</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>fixed</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>optional numeric vector of the same length as the total
 number of parameters.  If supplied, only <code>NA</code> entries in
 <code>fixed</code> will be varied.  <code>transform.pars = TRUE</code>
 will be overridden (with a warning) if any AR parameters are fixed.
 It may be wise to set <code>transform.pars = FALSE</code> when fixing
 MA parameters, especially near non-invertibility.
 </p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>init</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>optional numeric vector of initial parameter
 values.  Missing values will be filled in, by zeroes except for
 regression coefficients.  Values already specified in <code>fixed</code>
 will be ignored.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>method</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Fitting method: maximum likelihood or minimize
 conditional sum-of-squares.  The default (unless there are missing
 values) is to use conditional-sum-of-squares to find starting
 values, then maximum likelihood.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>n.cond</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>Only used if fitting by conditional-sum-of-squares: the
 number of initial observations to ignore.  It will be ignored if
 less than the maximum lag of an AR term.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>optim.method</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>The value passed as the <code>method</code> argument to
 <code>optim</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>optim.control</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>List of control parameters for <code>optim</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>kappa</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the prior variance (as a multiple of the innovations
 variance) for the past observations in a differenced model.  Do not
 reduce this.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>Different definitions of ARMA models have different signs for the
 AR and/or MA coefficients.  The definition used here has
 </p>
 <p align="center"><i>X[t] = a[1]X[t-1] + &hellip; + a[p]X[t-p] + e[t] + b[1]e[t-1] + &hellip; + b[q]e[t-q]</i></p>
 
 <p>and so the MA coefficients differ in sign from those of S-PLUS.
 Further, if <code>include.mean</code> is true (the default for an ARMA
 model), this formula applies to <i>X - m</i> rather than <i>X</i>.  For
 ARIMA models with differencing, the differenced series follows a
 zero-mean ARMA model. If am <code>xreg</code> term is included, a linear
 regression (with a constant term if <code>include.mean</code> is true and
 there is no differencing) is fitted with an ARMA model for the error
 term.
 </p>
 <p>The variance matrix of the estimates is found from the Hessian of
 the log-likelihood, and so may only be a rough guide.
 </p>
 <p>Optimization is done by <code>optim</code>.  It will work
 best if the columns in <code>xreg</code> are roughly scaled to zero mean
 and unit variance, but does attempt to estimate suitable scalings.

 <h3>Fitting methods</h3>
 
 
 <p>The exact likelihood is computed via a state-space representation of
 the ARIMA process, and the innovations and their variance found by a
 Kalman filter.  The initialization of the differenced ARMA process uses
 stationarity and is based on Gardner <EM>et al.</EM> (1980).  For a
 differenced process the non-stationary components are given a diffuse
 prior (controlled by <code>kappa</code>).  Observations which are still
 controlled by the diffuse prior (determined by having a Kalman gain of
 at least <code>1e4</code>) are excluded from the likelihood calculations.
 (This gives comparable results to <code>arima0</code> in the absence
 of missing values, when the observations excluded are precisely those
 dropped by the differencing.)
 </p>
 <p>Missing values are allowed, and are handled exactly in method <code>"ML"</code>.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>transform.pars</code> is true, the optimization is done using an
 alternative parametrization which is a variation on that suggested by
 Jones (1980) and ensures that the model is stationary.  For an AR(p)
 model the parametrization is via the inverse tanh of the partial
 autocorrelations: the same procedure is applied (separately) to the
 AR and seasonal AR terms.  The MA terms are not constrained to be
 invertible during optimization, but they will be converted to
 invertible form after optimization if <code>transform.pars</code> is true.
 </p>
 <p>Conditional sum-of-squares is provided mainly for expositional
 purposes.  This computes the sum of squares of the fitted innovations
 from observation <code>n.cond</code> on, (where <code>n.cond</code> is at least
 the maximum lag of an AR term), treating all earlier innovations to
 be zero.  Argument <code>n.cond</code> can be used to allow comparability
 between different fits.  The &lsquo;part log-likelihood&rsquo; is the first
 term, half the log of the estimated mean square.  Missing values
 are allowed, but will cause many of the innovations to be missing.
 </p>
 <p>When regressors are specified, they are orthogonalized prior to
 fitting unless any of the coefficients is fixed.  It can be helpful to
 roughly scale the regressors to zero mean and unit variance.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Note</h3>
 
 
 <p>The results are likely to be different from S-PLUS's
 <code>arima.mle</code>, which computes a conditional likelihood and does
 not include a mean in the model.  Further, the convention used by
 <code>arima.mle</code> reverses the signs of the MA coefficients.
 </p>
 <p><code>arima</code> is very similar to <code>arima0</code> for
 ARMA models or for differenced models without missing values,
 but handles differenced models with missing values exactly.
 It is somewhat slower than <code>arima0</code>, particularly for seasonally
 differenced models.
