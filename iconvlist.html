 <h2>Convert Character Vector between Encodings</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>This uses system facilities to convert a character vector between
 encodings: the &lsquo;i&rsquo; stands for &lsquo;internationalization&rsquo;.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 iconv(x, from = "", to = "", sub = NA, mark = TRUE, toRaw = FALSE)
 
 iconvlist()
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A character vector, or an object to be converted to a character
 vector by <code>as.character</code>, or a list with <code>NULL</code> and
 <code>raw</code> elements as returned by <code>iconv(toRaw = TRUE)</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>from</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A character string describing the current encoding.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>to</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>A character string describing the target encoding.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>sub</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>character string.  If not <code>NA</code> it is used to replace
 any non-convertible bytes in the input.  (This would normally be a
 single character, but can be more.)  If <code>"byte"</code>, the indication is
 <code>"&lt;xx&gt;"</code> with the hex code of the byte.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>mark</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical, for expert use.  Should encodings be marked?</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>toRaw</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical.  Should a list of raw vectors be returned rather
 than a character vector?</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The names of encodings and which ones are available are
 platform-dependent.  All <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> platforms support <code>""</code> (for the
 encoding of the current locale), <code>"latin1"</code> and <code>"UTF-8"</code>.
 Generally case is ignored when specifying an encoding.
 </p>
 <p>On many platforms, including Windows, <code>iconvlist</code> provides an
 alphabetical list of the supported encodings.  On others, the
 information is on the man page for <code>iconv(5)</code> or elsewhere in the
 man pages (but beware that the system command <code>iconv</code> may not
 support the same set of encodings as the C functions <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> calls).
 Unfortunately, the names are rarely valid across all platforms.
 </p>
 <p>Elements of <code>x</code> which cannot be converted (perhaps because they
 are invalid or because they cannot be represented in the target
 encoding) will be returned as <code>NA</code> unless <code>sub</code> is specified.
 </p>
 <p>Most versions of <code>iconv</code> will allow transliteration by appending
 <span class="samp">//TRANSLIT</span> to the <code>to</code> encoding: see the examples.
 </p>
 <p>Encoding <code>"ASCII"</code> is also accepted, and on most systems
 <code>"C"</code> and <code>"POSIX"</code> are synonyms for ASCII.
 </p>
 <p>Any encoding bits (see <code>Encoding</code>) on elements of <code>x</code>
 are ignored: they will always be translated as if from <code>from</code>
 even if declared otherwise.
 </p>
 <p><code>"UTF8"</code> will be accepted as meaning the (more correct) <code>"UTF-8"</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>If <code>toRaw = FALSE</code> (the default), the value is a character vector
 of the same length and the same attributes as <code>x</code> (after
 conversion to a character vector).
 </p>
 <p>If <code>mark = TRUE</code> (the default) the elements of the result have a
 declared encoding if <code>from</code> is <code>"latin1"</code> or <code>"UTF-8"</code>,
 or if <code>from = ""</code> and the current locale's encoding is detected
 as Latin-1 or UTF-8.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>toRaw = TRUE</code>, the value is a vector of the same length and
 the same attributes as <code>x</code> whose elements are either <code>NULL</code>
 (if conversion fails) or a raw vector.
 </p>
 <p>For <code>iconvlist()</code>, a character vector (typically of a few hundred
 elements).
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Implementation Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>There are three main implementations of <code>iconv</code> in use.
 <span class="samp">glibc</span> (as used on Linux) contains one.  Several platforms
 supply GNU <span class="samp">libiconv</span>, including Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Cygwin.
 On Windows we use a version of Yukihiro Nakadaira's <span class="samp">win_iconv</span>,
 which is based on Windows' codepages.  All three have
 <code>iconvlist</code>, ignore case in encoding names and support
 <span class="samp">//TRANSLIT</span> (but with different results, and for
 <span class="samp">win_iconv</span> currently a &lsquo;best fit&rsquo; strategy is used except
 for <code>to = "ASCII"</code>).
 </p>
 <p>Most commercial Unixes contain an implemetation of <code>iconv</code> but
 none we have encountered have supported the encoding names we need:
 the &ldquo;R Installation and Administration Manual&rdquo; recommends
 installing GNU <span class="samp">libiconv</span> on Solaris and AIX, for example.
 </p>
 <p>There are other implementations, e.g. NetBSD uses one from the Citrus
 project (which does not support <span class="samp">//TRANSLIT</span>) and there is an
 older FreeBSD port (<span class="samp">libiconv</span> is usually used there): it has not
 been reported whether or not these work with <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.
 </p>
 <p>Note that you cannot rely on invalid inputs being detected, especially
 for <code>to = "ASCII"</code> where some implementations allow 8-bit
 characters and pass them through unchanged or with transliteration.
