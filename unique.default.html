 <h2>Extract Unique Elements</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>unique</code> returns a vector, data frame or array like <code>x</code>
 but with duplicate elements/rows removed.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 unique(x, incomparables = FALSE, ...)
 
 ## Default S3 method:
 unique(x, incomparables = FALSE, fromLast = FALSE, ...)
 
 ## S3 method for class 'matrix'
 unique(x, incomparables = FALSE, MARGIN = 1,
        fromLast = FALSE, ...)
 
 ## S3 method for class 'array'
 unique(x, incomparables = FALSE, MARGIN = 1,
        fromLast = FALSE, ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a vector or a data frame or an array or <code>NULL</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>incomparables</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>a vector of values that cannot be compared.
 <code>FALSE</code> is a special value, meaning that all values can be
 compared, and may be the only value accepted for methods other than
 the default.  It will be coerced internally to the same type as
 <code>x</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>fromLast</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>logical indicating if duplication should be considered
 from the last, i.e., the last (or rightmost) of identical elements will
 be kept.  This only matters for <code>names</code> or
 <code>dimnames</code>.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>arguments for particular methods.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>MARGIN</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the array margin to be held fixed: a single integer.</p>
 </td></tr>
 </table>
 
 
 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>This is a generic function with methods for vectors, data frames and
 arrays (including matrices).
 </p>
 <p>The array method calculates for each element of the dimension
 specified by <code>MARGIN</code> if the remaining dimensions are identical
 to those for an earlier element (in row-major order).  This would most
 commonly be used for matrices to find unique rows (the default) or columns
 (with <code>MARGIN = 2</code>).
 </p>
 <p>Note that unlike the Unix command <code>uniq</code> this omits
 <EM>duplicated</EM> and not just <EM>repeated</EM> elements/rows.  That
 is, an element is omitted if it is equal to any previous element and
 not just if it is equal the immediately previous one.  (For the
 latter, see <code>rle</code>).
 </p>
 <p>Missing values are regarded as equal, but <code>NaN</code> is not equal to
 <code>NA_real_</code>.  Character strings are regarded as equal if they are
 in different encodings but would agree when translated to UTF-8.
 </p>
 <p>Values in <code>incomparables</code> will never be marked as duplicated.
 This is intended to be used for a fairly small set of values and will
 not be efficient for a very large set.
 </p>
 <p>When used on a data frame with more than one column, or an array or
 matrix when comparing dimensions of length greater than one, this
 tests for identity of character representations.  This will
 catch people who unwisely rely on exact equality of floating-point
 numbers!
 </p>
 <p>Character strings will be compared as byte sequences if any input is
 marked as <code>"bytes"</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>For a vector, an object of the same type of <code>x</code>, but with only
 one copy of each duplicated element.  No attributes are copied (so
 the result has no names).
 </p>
 <p>For a data frame, a data frame is returned with the same columns but
 possibly fewer rows (and with row names from the first occurrences of
 the unique rows).
 </p>
 <p>A matrix or array is subsetted by <code>[, drop = FALSE]</code>, so
 dimensions and dimnames are copied appropriately, and the result
 always has the same number of dimensions as <code>x</code>.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Warning</h3>
 
 
 <p>Using this for lists is potentially slow, especially if the elements
 are not atomic vectors (see <code>vector</code>) or differ only
 in their attributes.  In the worst case it is <i>O(n^2)</i>.

 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>
 x &lt;- c(3:5, 11:8, 8 + 0:5)
 (ux &lt;- unique(x))
 (u2 &lt;- unique(x, fromLast = TRUE)) # different order
 stopifnot(identical(sort(ux), sort(u2)))
 
 length(unique(sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE)))
 ## approximately 100(1 - 1/e) = 63.21
 
 unique(iris)
