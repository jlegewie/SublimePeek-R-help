 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>
 
 
 # By default, the group is set to the interaction of all discrete variables in the
 # plot. This often partitions the data correctly, but when it does not, or when
 # no discrete variable is used in the plot, you will need to explicitly define the
 # grouping structure, by mapping group to a variable that has a different value
 # for each group.
 
 # For most applications you can simply specify the grouping with
 # various aesthetics (colour, shape, fill, linetype) or with facets.
 
 p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))
 # A basic scatter plot
 p + geom_point(size = 4)
 # The colour aesthetic
 p + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cyl)), size = 4)
 # Or you can use shape to distinguish the data
 p + geom_point(aes(shape = factor(cyl)), size = 4)
 
 # Using fill
 a &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl)))
 a + geom_bar()
 a + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(cyl)))
 a + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(vs)))
 
 # Using linetypes
 library(reshape2) # for melt
 library(plyr) # for colwise
 rescale01 &lt;- function(x) (x - min(x)) / diff(range(x))
 ec_scaled &lt;- data.frame(
   date = economics$date,
   colwise(rescale01)(economics[, -(1:2)]))
 ecm &lt;- melt(ec_scaled, id = "date")
 f &lt;- ggplot(ecm, aes(date, value))
 f + geom_line(aes(linetype = variable))
 
 # Using facets
 k &lt;- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, ..density..)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
 k + facet_grid(. ~ cut)
 
 # There are three common cases where the default is not enough, and we
 # will consider each one below. In the following examples, we will use a simple
 # longitudinal dataset, Oxboys, from the nlme package. It records the heights
 # (height) and centered ages (age) of 26 boys (Subject), measured on nine
 # occasions (Occasion).
 
 # Multiple groups with one aesthetic
 library(nlme)
 h &lt;- ggplot(Oxboys, aes(age, height))
 # A single line tries to connect all the observations
 h + geom_line()
 # The group aesthetic maps a different line for each subject
 h + geom_line(aes(group = Subject))
 
 # Different groups on different layers
 h &lt;- h + geom_line(aes(group = Subject))
 # Using the group aesthetic with both geom_line() and geom_smooth()
 # groups the data the same way for both layers
 h + geom_smooth(aes(group = Subject), method = "lm", se = FALSE)
 # Changing the group aesthetic for the smoother layer
 # fits a single line of best fit across all boys
 h + geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), size = 2, method = "lm", se = FALSE)
 
 # Overriding the default grouping
 # The plot has a discrete scale but you want to draw lines that connect across
 # groups. This is the strategy used in interaction plots, profile plots, and parallel
 # coordinate plots, among others. For example, we draw boxplots of height at
 # each measurement occasion
 boysbox &lt;- ggplot(Oxboys, aes(Occasion, height))
 boysbox + geom_boxplot()
 # There is no need to specify the group aesthetic here; the default grouping
 # works because occasion is a discrete variable. To overlay individual trajectories
 # we again need to override the default grouping for that layer with aes(group = Subject)
 boysbox &lt;- boysbox + geom_boxplot()
 boysbox + geom_line(aes(group = Subject), colour = "blue")
 
 # Use the order aesthetic to change stacking order of bar charts
 w &lt;- ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill = cut))
 w + geom_bar()
 w + geom_bar(aes(order = desc(cut)))
 
 # Can also be used to change plot order of scatter plots
 d &lt;- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, colour = cut))
 d + geom_point()
 d + geom_point(aes(order = sample(seq_along(carat))))
