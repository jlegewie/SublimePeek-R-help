 <h2>Quote Text</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p>Single or double quote text by combining with appropriate single or
 double left and right quotation marks.

 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>an <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> object, to be coerced to a character vector.</p>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p>The purpose of the functions is to provide a simple means of markup
 for quoting text to be used in the R output, e.g., in warnings or
 error messages.
 </p>
 <p>The choice of the appropriate quotation marks depends on both the
 locale and the available character sets.  Older Unix/X11 fonts
 displayed the grave accent (ASCII code 0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27)
 in a way that they could also be used as matching open and close
 single quotation marks.  Using modern fonts, or non-Unix systems,
 these characters no longer produce matching glyphs.  Unicode provides
 left and right single quotation mark characters (U+2018 and U+2019);
 if Unicode markup cannot be assumed to be available, it seems good
 practice to use the apostrophe as a non-directional single quotation
 mark.
 </p>
 <p>Similarly, Unicode has left and right double quotation mark characters
 (U+201C and U+201D); if only ASCII's typewriter characteristics can be
 employed, than the ASCII quotation mark (0x22) should be used as both
 the left and right double quotation mark.
 </p>
 <p>Some other locales also have the directional quotation marks, notably
 on Windows.  TeX uses grave and apostrophe for the directional single
 quotation marks, and doubled grave and doubled apostrophe for the
 directional double quotation marks.
 </p>
 <p>What rendering is used depend on the <code>options</code> setting for
 <code>useFancyQuotes</code>.  If this is <code>FALSE</code> then the undirectional
 ASCII quotation style is used.  If this is <code>TRUE</code> (the default),
 Unicode directional quotes are used are used where available
 (currently, UTF-8 locales on Unix-alikes and all Windows locales
 except <code>C</code>): if set to <code>"UTF-8"</code> UTF-8 markup is used
 (whatever the current locale). If set to <code>"TeX"</code>, TeX-style
 markup is used.  Finally, if this is set to a character vector of
 length four, the first two entries are used for beginning and ending
 single quotes and the second two for beginning and ending double
 quotes: this can be used to implement non-English quoting conventions
 such as the use of guillemets.
 </p>
 <p>Where fancy quotes are used, you should be aware that they may not be
 rendered correctly as not all fonts include the requisite glyphs: for
 example some have directional single quotes but not directional double
 quotes.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>A character vector in the current locale's encoding.
