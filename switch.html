 <h2>Select One of a List of Alternatives</h2>
 
 <h3>Description</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>switch</code> evaluates <code>EXPR</code> and accordingly chooses one of the
 further arguments (in <code>...</code>).
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Usage</h3>
 
 <pre>
 switch(EXPR, ...)
 </pre>
 
 
 <h3>Arguments</h3>
 
 
 <table summary="R argblock">
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>EXPR</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>an expression evaluating to a number or a character
 string.</p>
 </td></tr>
 <tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
 <td>
 <p>the list of alternatives.  If it is intended that
 <code>EXPR</code> has a character-string value these will be
 named, perhaps except for one alternative to be used as a
 &lsquo;default&rsquo; value.</p>
 </td></tr>

 <h3>Details</h3>
 
 
 <p><code>switch</code> works in two distinct ways depending whether the first
 argument evaluates to a character string or a number.
 </p>
 <p>If the value of <code>EXPR</code> is not a character string it is coerced to
 integer.  If this is between 1 and <code>nargs()-1</code> then the
 corresponding element of <code>...</code> is evaluated and the result
 returned: thus if the first argument is <code>3</code> then the fourth
 argument is evaluated and returned.
 </p>
 <p>If <code>EXPR</code> evaluates to a character string then that string is
 matched (exactly)to the names of the elements in <code>...</code>.  If
 there is a match then that element is evaluated unless it is missing,
 in which case the next non-missing element is evaluated, so for
 example <code>switch("cc", a=1, cc=, cd=, d=2)</code> evaluates to <code>2</code>.
 If there is more than one match, the first matching element is used.
 In the case of no match, if there is a unnamed element of <code>...</code>
 its value is returned.  (If there is more than one such argument 
 an error is returned.  Before <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.13.0 the first one would have
 been used.)
 </p>
 <p>The first argument is always taken to be <code>EXPR</code>: if it is named
 its name must (partially) match.
 </p>
 <p>This is implemented as a primitive function that only evaluates
 its first argument and one other if one is selected.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Value</h3>
 
 
 <p>The value of one of the elements of <code>...</code>, or <code>NULL</code>,
 invisibly (whenever no element is selected).
 </p>
 <p>The result has the visibility (see <code>invisible</code>) of the
 element evaluated.
 </p>
 
 
 <h3>Warning</h3>
 
 
 <p>Before <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.11.0 it was necessary to avoid partial matching: an
 alternative <code>E = foo</code> matched the first argument <code>EXPR</code>
 unless that was named.
 </p>
 <p>It is possible to write calls to <code>switch</code> that can be confusing
 and may not work in the same way in earlier versions of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.  For
 compatibility (and clarity), always have <code>EXPR</code> as the first
 argument, naming it if partial matching is a possibility.  For the
 character-string form, have a single unnamed argument as the default
 after the named values.

 <h3>Examples</h3>
 
 <pre>
 require(stats)
 centre &lt;- function(x, type) {
   switch(type,
          mean = mean(x),
          median = median(x),
          trimmed = mean(x, trim = .1))
 }
 x &lt;- rcauchy(10)
 centre(x, "mean")
 centre(x, "median")
 centre(x, "trimmed")
 
 ccc &lt;- c("b","QQ","a","A","bb")
 # note: cat() produces no output for NULL
 for(ch in ccc)
     cat(ch,":", switch(EXPR = ch, a=1,     b=2:3), "\n")
 for(ch in ccc)
     cat(ch,":", switch(EXPR = ch, a=, A=1, b=2:3, "Otherwise: last"),"\n")
 
 ## Numeric EXPR does not allow a default value to be specified
 ## -- it is always NULL
 for(i in c(-1:3,9))  print(switch(i, 1,2,3,4))
 
 ## visibility
 switch(1, invisible(pi), pi)
 switch(2, invisible(pi), pi)
